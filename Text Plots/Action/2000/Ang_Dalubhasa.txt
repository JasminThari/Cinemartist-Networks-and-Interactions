Jimmy de Guzman is a military doctor and is the lone survivor of a massacre during his wife's boss' farewell dinner. He spends years hunting down the criminals until he is able to kill the last of them and avenges his wife, her boss and his daughter. Returning to his normal life, he becomes a respected military neurosurgeon, and is engaged to the daughter of one of a hospital tycoon in Cebu. When his fianc√©e's niece suffers an aneurism, Jimmy is the lead surgeon, but the girl dies while recuperating, with Jimmy taking the blame. Shamed, he escapes to Manila where he spends his days drinking to drown his sorrow.

In his new home, Jimmy enjoys being incognito. After overcoming alcoholism, he becomes respected by the community, and his legend grows further when he conducts an appendectomy on son of a police officer during a flood. It was then revealed that a co-doctor, jealous of his success, deliberately overdosed his former fiancee's niece. This comes about after the doctor confessed to his wife and every one in the party that he poisoned the girl, causing his wife to disown him and have him arrested for it.

Jimmy later discovers that he has not fully avenged his family as the leader of the criminals that killed his wife is still on the loose with a new band of men. After a firefight aboard a docked ship, Jimmy finally kills the leader ending his journey.

He is coaxed to go back to Cebu but he choose to remain with new friends and newfound love.

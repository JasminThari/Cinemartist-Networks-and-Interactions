Ramadurga and Rayadurga are two villages, which are always feuding as the headmen Ramegowda and Rayappa have personal enmity. Due to some misunderstanding regarding Rayappa's son's death, Rayappa seeks revenge against Ramegowda and tries to kill Ramegowda's son Nandeesha, but Nandeesha is saved by his servant's son Shiva, where Nandeesha suddenly disappears. 20 years later, Shiva arrives in Krishnarajapuram with a mission to protect a strict officer named Bharavi Sindhuri and his son Shiva Nandi from Rayappa and his gangsters. During a wedding reception, Shiva saves Bharavi and Nandi from being murdered by Rayappa's son. Later, Shiva reveals that Bharavi's Tehsildar husband was actually Nandeesha whom Rayappa had killed after learning about his real identity. To protect the rest of the family, Shiva was sent by Ramegowda to bring them back to the village. In the present, Shiva brings  Bharavi and Nandi back to the village, and finally wipes out Rayappa and his family during the temple festival, thus avenging Nandeesha's death.

After the events from the previous film, Inspector Chulbul Pandey takes charge of a local police station in Kanpur and resides there with his wife Rajjo, half-brother Makkhi and stepfather Prajapati Pandey. In Kanpur, an assassin murders a witness who is about to testify against a dreaded gangster and politician named Thakur Bachcha Singh. 

Chulbul tracks the assassin down, killing him at a coffeehouse. After several public altercations, Bachcha's brother Genda convinces him to get rid of Pandey, threatening Prajapati Pandey to kill his entire family if Chulbul keeps on interfering in Bachcha's illegal activities. Genda harasses a girl at her wedding, where Chulbul arrives at the wedding and asks Genda to leave. Genda refuses and continues to insult Chulbul, who breaks his neck, leading to his death. 

Meanwhile, Rajjo becomes pregnant and Chulbul is advised by everybody to leave Bachcha alone for the sake of his family's safety. Bachcha promises to avenge his brother's death before the election, where he meets Rajjo and Makkhi while they were leaving a temple. Makkhi is shot by Bachcha and Rajjo is pushed off the temple stairs. Rajjo and Makkhi survives, but Rajjo suffers a  miscarriage. 

Enraged, Chulbul enters Bachcha's location and kills all of his men, including Bachcha. Later, Chulbul and Rajjo bear a baby boy and Chedi Singh's photographer asks for a family photo. They all laugh and the photographer takes the picture.

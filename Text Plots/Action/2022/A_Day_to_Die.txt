Connor Connolly, a disgraced parole officer, becomes indebted to a local drug kingpin, Tyrone Pettis, after having no choice but to kill one of the latter's young enforcers (an "asset"). Upon having his pregnant wife Candice abducted by Pettis as leverage, Connor is forced to pull off a series of dangerous drug heists within twelve hours in order to pay the $2 million dollars he now owes. Connor recruits his old teammates to conduct the heists with him, rescue his kidnapped pregnant wife, and settle a score with the city's corrupt police chief Alston who had double-crossed them years ago in a botched hostage situation that led to the former team's disbandment. Alston is secretly in an uneasy alliance with Pettis, who has financed his rise to power. The team goes through with the heists, and confronts Pettis whilst rescuing Candice, before coming to a mutual understanding and engaging in one final heist in an attempt to disrupt Alston's criminal operations. In the end, Connor, Pettis, and Candice successfully flee the country, while Alston, having been recorded during the ongoing heist gunning down one of his subordinates who was catching onto his illicit activities, is arrested.

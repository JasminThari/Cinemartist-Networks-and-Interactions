Jack Severino (Dominique Vandenberg) is a quiet yet intense man who has no recollection of his past. He spends his time in violent Vale Tudo fights in a small South American village. The only friend he has is his manager Manolo (Steven Bauer), an Indian trying to escape poverty. Jack's violent past catches up with him when he sees a woman (Stana Katic) he has not seen in years bring back his memories.

Zamir, a street tough, has been in love with Kim ever since he saved her from rapists. However, the only way he knows how to express his affection is by attacking any man who shows interest in her. Although Kim tolerates Zamir's infatuation, she keeps him at a distance. When Max Kalba arrives in town seeking revenge against Kim's father, Zamir tries to rescue her once again. Unfortunately, Kalba overpowers Zamir and kidnaps Kim's father, who is the Master at the Korean martial arts school.

Kim and Zamir flee and take refuge with a mystical dwarf named Nik Nak, who explains that Kalba plans to kill everyone linked to the "Sect" of martial artists to which Kim and Zamir's fathers belonged. Through a series of flashbacks, a love triangle between Kim's parents and Kalba is revealed, resulting in her mother's suicide.

While Zamir trains with a drunken Sect member named Jose Soto, Kalba's minions kidnap Kim. Zamir learns to fight in the "Zeta" style and is given a pair of bladed spurs for his feet. He arrives at Kalba's headquarters and quickly dispatches Kalba's minions before fighting Kalba himself. During the fight, Kalba reveals that he murdered Zamir's mother, which infuriates Zamir and gives him the strength to defeat Kalba.

Afterward, Zamir checks on Kim, and she thanks him with a second kiss. Zamir then leaves to reunite with Jos√© Soto, whom he has just learned is his father.

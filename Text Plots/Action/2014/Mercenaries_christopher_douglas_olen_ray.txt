During a visit to Kazakhstan, the daughter of the U.S. President is captured and held for ransom by Ulrika, a female warlord. The CIA tasks agent Mona Kendall to create a team to rescue the first daughter from Ulrika's base, a former Soviet prison nicknamed "The Citadel". The team Kendall puts together were all serving time in U.S. prisons, but are offered full pardons for taking part in the operation.

With the help of a local girl, the four-woman team gains access to The Citadel, but just as they are about to escape after rescuing the first daughter, one of their number turns against them.

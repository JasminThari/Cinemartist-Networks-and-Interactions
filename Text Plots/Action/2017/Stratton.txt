After a failed mission to destroy an Iranian bioweapon, British Special Boat Service operator Sergeant John Stratton, working for the Intelligence Detachment in Northern Ireland, tracks down the terrorist cell who used the mission as cover to steal the weapon for their own purposes. Due to the failed mission, Stratton suspects a mole. His boss Sumner recognizes the terrorist leader as Grigory Barovsky, a Russian spy, presumed dead for nearly twenty years. They learn a bomb maker has developed a drone system to disperse the bioweapon, which is more lethal at high altitudes, and track the terrorists to Rome.

There is a speedboat chase with heavy gunfire, before the final action sequence, which takes place in London with the poison device loaded onto a double-decker bus whose destination is shown as Clapham Common (so as to blend in). The device is configured to automatically deploy (via a drone) through an opening cut into the bus's roof once it arrives at a location preprogrammed into the device's firmware.

Stratton and his American counterpart Hank chase after the bus in a Range Rover to stop Barovsky from deploying the device. During the chase sequence, Stratton jumps from the Range Rover to board the bus where he is involved in a struggle with one of Barovsky's accomplices. Whilst being choked by Barovsky's accomplice he shouts across to Hank, who is still driving alongside the bus, to use a grenade to stop the bus. Hank throws the grenade under the bus which explodes and causes the bus to flip on its side, slide and crash. Barovsky tries to launch the drone manually but is shot and killed. An anti-terrorist unit blows up the drone.

The Cambodian police arrests a mobster known as Playboy (Savin Phillip), whom they assume to be the leader of the notorious Butterfly gang. Three local cops (Dara Our, Tharoth Sam and Dara Phang), and a French-Cambodian police officer on an exchange scheme (Jean-Paul Ly), escort Playboy to prison. The mobster reveals that he is not the gang's true boss, and promises to deliver information about his employer. The gang's real leader, Madame Butterfly (CÃ©line Tran), informed that Playboy is about to squeal, puts a bounty on her accomplice's head. This sparks a riot in the jail, with all the prisoners trying to get their hands on Playboy.

The police officers, who were on their way out of the prison as the riot began, have to fight against the inmates to save their lives and protect their key witness. Meanwhile, Madame Butterfly and her henchwomen come to the prison in order to finish the job themselves.

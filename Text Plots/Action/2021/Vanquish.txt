Retired disabled cop Damon (Morgan Freeman) forces Victoria (Ruby Rose), a former drug courier and his caretaker, to collect bags of money around the city during a single night by holding her daughter hostage. As the night progresses, Victoria finds out that at every stop point she makes, various enemies from her past attack her. Meanwhile, a cop breaks into Damon’s home, but Damon kills him.

At her final stop, Victoria is captured and taken to the home of the corrupt Governor. The Governor asks for Victoria’s help in taking down Damon, but Victoria refuses and kills the Governor instead.

Upon finally returning to Damon’s home, Victoria is reunited with her daughter. Then Damon explains that he had no need for the money that Victoria had collected; instead, this night was a part of his plan to eliminate all of Victoria’s enemies along with the corrupt Governor, thus cleaning the city of crime and corruption.

As the dawn breaks, Damon lures all the corrupted cops that had been working for the Governor into his home, where he blows himself up along with them. Meanwhile, Victoria and her daughter escape safely.

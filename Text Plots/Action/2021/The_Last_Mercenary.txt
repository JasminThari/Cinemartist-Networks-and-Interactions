Richard Brumere is a secret agent who worked for the government. During an operation, Richard had impregnated the ex-wife of his friend Jouard. The two have a son named Archibald al Mahmoud. His wife asks that her son be given two things: money given by the government and someone to take care of him. An agent by the name of Fernand was assigned to take care of him and did so for the past couple of years. Archibald never knew his father, so he always assumed Fernand was his dad. Meanwhile, at a bank, Ministre Sivardiere had discovered a fake employee providing Archibald al Mahmoud with money for the past couple of years. Also, Archibald al Mahmoud was considered a terrorist wanted for arms and drug trafficking. Sivardiere had shut down the money, which also erased the immunity, leading government agents to pursue him. Agents show up at his home, and with the use of a device only known as the Big Mac, Fernand has a heart attack after his pacemaker fails due to the Big Mac frying the electrical signal. Archibald tries to get away but is arrested. He is interrogated about his alleged activities but is passed out. Richard finds out about his son and how he's being held by the government and stages a rescue. After a lengthy brawl with agents, Richard saves his son but does not disclose he is the father by using the alias, George. While getting away and kidnapping a willing Sivardiere, Richard is exposed, and Archibald feels betrayed. Richard reminisces about his wife twirling the pendant around her finger. Archibald comes out and realizes he was the man who comforted him at the funeral, realizing he was never truly abandoned. After recovering the Big Mac, Jouard realizes that Richard still had to be taken in for the events of the prior operation Cup-and-Ball. Richard triggers the Big Mac killing the power in the building and escaping but still promises to be there for his son.

Enteng Kabisote has been living comfortably even without his other companions: Aiza, who is living in a faraway town; his wife Faye still in Encantasya; and Amy and her husband gone. But he is torn between his son Benok and his pampered grandson, Benokis. He argues with Benok over who is right to raise his own son and goes on vacation in Bohol, meeting a member of "Abangers" who has the power of iron. He approaches a hotel attendant Georgia and Nicomaine and thinks the tour guide Richard is a handsome man, but disappointed, he continues the tour.

Three old triplets run a factory until the workers go into a strike and are exiled as punishment.

Kwak Kwak is one of those so-called OEWs that is banished by the leaders, hatches a plan to eliminate the Abangers and eventually Enteng so that his vengeance will be complete. He has sidekicks with duckfaces and other of his minions who are also exiled Encantados.

Enteng was given a powered suit by the Abangers when they meet, but Kwak Kwak and his minions attacks and captures him and the group. They are put in stasis when Enteng pleads with the scientist to renege. The group later faces and defeats Kwak Kwak and his minions.

The closing scenes depict what happened to the Abangers: one has owned a gym, another became a comedy bar owner; another built a fortune teller shop in Makati that caters to the elite; the three Lolas became ''Eat Bulaga!'''s characters (a nod from Kalyeserye's Explorer sisters); and the tour guide built his own shop. Enteng reunites with his family while talking to somebody on his phone.

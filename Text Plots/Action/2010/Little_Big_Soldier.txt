The film is set in the 3rd century BC during the Warring States period of China. After a battle between the states of  Liang and Wey, only two men are left alive – a Liang foot soldier and a Wey general. The Soldier survived because he is an expert in playing dead, with a device protruding like an arrowhead strapped to his body for added realism.

The Soldier captures the wounded General, hoping to use him as a ticket to freedom – by handing an enemy general to the king of Liang, the Soldier can be honourably discharged from military service and return home to a peaceful life. The young General, though taken captive, is condescending towards the Soldier. The two men are often at loggerheads during the long and winding journey, but are forced to work together in order to survive in a variety of circumstances: being tricked by a singer who blames them for the war; being nearly killed by a bear in the woods; being attacked by a group of beggars; and being captured and enslaved by a group of Loufan warriors.

To make matters more complicated, the General is actually the crown prince of Wey. Prince Wen, the General's younger brother, is coveting the throne of Wey. When he learns that the General has survived the battle, he leads his men on a relentless attempt to hunt down and kill the General in order to secure his claim to the throne. Although they stand on opposing sides, the Soldier ends up siding with the General against Prince Wen.

The General and Prince Wen decide to cooperate when they are attacked by the Loufan warriors, whose leader is seeking revenge on Prince Wen for killing his wife earlier. At the end of the fight, Prince Wen commits suicide to appease the Loufan leader and tells the General that one of them needs to live in order to ensure the continuity of Wey.

In the end, the Soldier brings the General back to Liang, but changes his mind at the last minute and releases the General – after the General promises that Wey will not wage war on Liang for the next ten years if he becomes the king of Wey. Turning towards Liang, the Soldier is shocked to see that his home state has been conquered by the state of Qin. Depressed that his quest was in vain to begin with and there is nothing left for him to return to, the Soldier raises the Liang flag in defiance to the Qins so the Qin soldiers fire arrows at him. Still proudly holding up the Liang flag, the Soldier collapses and dies. The state of Wey ultimately surrenders to the state of Qin without a fight.<ref name="synopsis">{{cite news|work=Twitch|author=Al Young|title=Second teaser for Jackie Chan's LITTLE BIG SOLDIER|url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2009/12/second-teaser-for-jackie-chans-little-big-soldier.php|date=2009-12-01|accessdate=2009-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616092543/http://twitchfilm.net/news/2009/12/second-teaser-for-jackie-chans-little-big-soldier.php|archive-date=16 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

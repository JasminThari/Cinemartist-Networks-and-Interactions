Ma Ho-tin, So Kin-chow and Cheung Tsz-wai are good brothers who grew up together. When they grew up, they were stationed in the Narcotics Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force. Among them, Chow has been undercover for a long time in the drug trafficking group. He can't live a normal life and make him extremely annoyed. Big brother A Tian and his detective brother A Wei often persuade him that he can return to the team after catching the last big drug lord. The high-level police force asked Aqiu to follow up to catch a long line to catch big fish. Chow was deeply dissatisfied. The last three brothers decided to go to Thailand to catch the big poisonous eight-faced Buddha and help Chow to escape. However, due to the safety concerns of Aqiu, he was reluctant to conduct a fake drug transaction with the Eight-faced Buddha. He secretly used the telephone to contact the other party and said that the transaction was cancelled, which led to the suspicion that the Eight-faced Buddha had bought the drug party Aqiu and others. After the war, the two sides forced Ho-tin to choose a rescue between Chow and Cheung. Finally, Ho-tin chose to save Chow, and Cheung was shot in the crocodile pool. Cheung's death made both Ho-tin and Chow deeply saddened. The two also took care of Cheung’s mother who was hospitalized for her illness and amnesia. Aqi’s wife broke up with Aqiu after giving birth to her daughter.

Karaoke manager and band leader Sze-to Bo is a judo expert and former champion who gave up judo a few years ago for unknown reasons, becoming depressed and an alcoholic. Current judo champion Tony, a competitive fighter, admires Bo and challenges him to a duel. Bo's longtime rival, Lee Ah-kong, also arrives to challenge Bo for an old unfinished competition.

Mona is a woman from Taiwan who dreams of becoming a singer, but was nearly forced into prostitution by her evil manager; she seeks refuge in Bo's karaoke. She joins Bo in finding his mentor, Cheng, an old, frail man with a dementia-ridden son, Ching. Cheng asks his disciple to help him to restore the reputation of his dojo, which have become a depressing ruins.

Bo eventually can no longer keep his secret and reveals the true reason he gave up judo: he had developed an incurable retinal disease and his vision is gradually declining; he only has one tenth of his vision left. When Master Cheng dies for his ideals battling on the judo stage, Bo's fighting spirit reignites. Bo is determined to defeat all his opponents before seeing the last line of light.

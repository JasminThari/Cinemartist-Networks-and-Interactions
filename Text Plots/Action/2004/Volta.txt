Perla is a dressmaker who lives and works for her siblings, Percy and Penny since her mother died. After being hit by lightning thrice, Perla discovers that she has developed superpowers: She can generate heat and electricity with her hands, and lightning flashes come out of her hands. With these powers, she becomes famous as the superhero, Volta. However, her siblings resent her, as they blame her powers for mishaps they encountered earlier in their lives. Perla is initially reluctant to use her powers openly but meets Ama, a ball of light with a human face who encourages him to use her powers for good and teaches her how to manage them. 

Volta's main antagonist is Celphora , who wants to use Volta as a power source for her Telstra Technology. She sends her minions on the rampage to lure Volta into revealing herself before posing as a workmate of Percy to lure him into spilling his sister's secret by pretending to comfort him after another quarrel with Perla over her powers, only to capture him and Penny to use as bait for Volta. Celphora demands that Volta transfer her powers to her in exchange for her siblings' freedom which she complies, But despite gaining her powers, Celphora is killed by Volta using her lightning with a steel rod. Her siblings, now realizing the need for Volta and Perla's sacrifice, reconcile with their sister.

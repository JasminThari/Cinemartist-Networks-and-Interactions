In 1905, Sun Wen intends to make a secret trip to British-ruled Hong Kong to discuss plans with fellow revolutionaries to overthrow the corrupt Qing Empire and establish a republic in China. When the Qing government learns of his trip, they send a group of assassins to infiltrate Hong Kong and assassinate him when he shows up. Ahead of Sun's arrival, newspaper editor Chen Shaobai meets businessman Li Yutang, who has been secretly financing the revolutionaries, to inform him about the upcoming meeting. Trouble also begins brewing in Hong Kong when Chen's acquaintances are murdered by the assassins, who also kidnap Chen during their raid. Li officially declares his support for the revolutionaries after the newspaper agency is closed by the British authorities, who do not interfere in the Chinese political situation. He also gathers a motley crew of people from all walks of life, including rickshaw pullers, hawkers and a beggar, to protect Sun and ensure that the meeting goes uninterrupted. Li's son, Chongguang, is selected to serve as Sun's decoy to distract the assassins while Sun attends the meeting and leaves Hong Kong safely.

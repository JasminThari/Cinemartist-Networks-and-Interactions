In ancient China, the evil warlord Lord Godless aims to conquer the country. He captures the emperor, poisons numerous martial arts masters, and gives them the ultimatum to join him or die. However, Nameless, a renowned martial artist, breaks free and administers the antidote to the captive masters. Despite their combined efforts, Lord Godless remains unaffected by their attacks and kills them.

Nameless, Cloud, Wind, and Chu Chu manage to escape with the help of other martial artists. However, Nameless is gravely injured and unable to recover quickly. He sends Cloud and Wind to seek Lord Wicked, the only person capable of defeating Lord Godless. Lord Wicked, who had abandoned his violent ways, reluctantly agrees to help after Wind's lover, Second Dream, persuades him.

Meanwhile, Cloud trains under a disguised Nameless at Lin Yi Temple. Nameless recognizes Cloud's potential and creates a new sword style called "Ba." Lord Godless discovers their location and sends his lieutenants, Earth and Sky, to kill Nameless. Cloud easily defeats them, but Wind interrupts his training to save Second Dream, who gets injured. Wind's departure halts his training prematurely.

Cloud sets out to confront Lord Godless, who has taken the emperor hostage in search of the Dragon Tomb, a place containing a significant secret for China's destiny. Cloud fights Heartless, Lord Godless's son, and later engages in a battle with Lord Godless himself. Despite Cloud's skills, Lord Godless's armor renders him nearly invincible. However, a hidden entrance to the Dragon Tomb is revealed during their fight.

Wind, possessed by evil arts, arrives and fights against Lord Godless, Cloud, and eventually both of them. He kills Lord Godless and takes the Dragon Bone from the tomb. Cloud pursues Wind, while the emperor urges him to retrieve the Dragon Bone for the sake of China's fate.

Wind reaches a secret place mentioned in a letter from Second Dream, but he remains unresponsive. The emperor's guards attempt to reclaim the Dragon Bone, resulting in a struggle between the General and Heartless. As the bone breaks, Wind succumbs entirely to the evil spirit. Cloud arrives and fights Wind in an attempt to save him but fails, resulting in tragic consequences.

In a final act of sacrifice, Cloud pushes Wind and Second Dream to safety but plunges into the depths himself. Wind regrets that Cloud did not kill him earlier when he had the chance. The movie ends abruptly, leaving Cloud's fate uncertain and Wind grieving over the choices made.

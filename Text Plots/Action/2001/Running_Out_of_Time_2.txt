The film brings back Inspector Ho Sheung-sang (Lau Ching-wan), this time to contend with another clever thief (Ekin Cheng, whose character is nameless). This time around, the thief is determined to extort money from a high-strung businesswoman (Kelly Lin) and play a few rounds of clever games with Ho in the process.

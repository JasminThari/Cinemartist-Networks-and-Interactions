Logging company owner and family man Joe Braven lives with his wife Stephanie, daughter Charlotte, and his father Linden. Linden, who suffers from dementia due to a previous head injury, gets into a bar room brawl, ending up in the hospital. When the doctor recommends a more supervised approach for Linden, Stephanie suggests Joe take Linden to the family's secluded mountain cabin to talk about the situation.

While transporting logs and drugs by truck, Joe's co-worker Weston and Hallett, a drug trafficker, get into an accident and store the cocaine in Joe's mountain cabin. They take refuge at a motel, where Hallett relays the news to his employer, drug lord Kassen.

Upon their arrival at the cabin, Joe discovers the cocaine in the shed. He hides Charlotte, who tagged along, in a storage closet before they are surrounded by Kassen's mercenaries. Kassen kills Weston in front of Joe. Unable to call for help with the lack of cell service, Joe and Linden arm themselves and kill one of the mercenaries.

Needing higher ground to access a cellular network, Joe causes a distraction and drives away on a quad bike with Charlotte. He instructs her to climb to the mountain, where she calls her mother, who in turn calls the sheriff. Another mercenary attacks Joe but he drives the quad off a cliff into the sea, killing the mercenary and almost dying himself. Hallett enters the cabin and is stabbed with a skewer by Linden, killing him.

A bow-wielding Stephanie saves Charlotte from a mercenary. Joe returns to the cabin, where he kills two more men. Charlotte is picked up by the sheriff as Stephanie is pursued in the woods. Kassen takes Linden hostage and fatally stabs him in front of Joe. He escapes with the lost cocaine but Joe chases after him. He helps Stephanie kill her pursuer before engaging in a violent knife fight with Kassen on the cliff. He pushes Kassen off the edge, killing him, before being reunited with his family.

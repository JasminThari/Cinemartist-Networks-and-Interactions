Mun is a Korean immigrant to Thailand, and a taekwondo master running an old taekwondo gym in Bangkok. All five members of his family are also taekwondo exponents, each of whom infuses the art with a particular skill: his wife Mija in cooking style, son Taeyang in dancing style, daughter Taemi in soccer style, and the youngest, Typhoon, in the style of brute strength; he can break anything with his strong forehead.

Mun wants his children to become taekwondo coaches and take over his gym in the future. However, Taeyang wants to be a famous pop singer and Taemi is only interested in her classmate at school, whom she harbors a secret crush on.

One day, Taeyang foils a gang's attempt to steal a priceless antique kris. Pom, the leader of the gang, is the only one to escape and threatens revenge. Mun's family becomes more popular in the public eye, but they do not know when or where Pom will try to get his revenge, and must put aside their differences to stand up for their family.

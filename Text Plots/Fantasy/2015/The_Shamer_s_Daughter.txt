The King of Dunark has been murdered along with his pregnant wife and his 4-year-old son. The apparent killer is the King's elder son, Nicodemus Ravens (Jakob Oftebro), and has been found dead drunk, holding a dagger in his hand. But so long as he does not admit to his crime, he cannot be found guilty. The Master of Law sends for Melussina Tonerre (Maria Bonnevie), a "witch" who has the gift of probing someone's mind. Although she sees Nicodemus' remorse for his past behavior, she finds no shame for the royal family's slaughter. To further the trial, Lord Drakan (Peter Plaugborg) goes and picks up Dina (Rebecca Emilie Satrup), Melussina's daughter, who has the same ability. When Dina is placed before Nico to look through his shame, she sees the same as her mother, she sees that Nico has a lot to be ashamed of, but that he has no relation to the murder of the king.

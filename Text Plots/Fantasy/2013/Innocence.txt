Beckett (Sophie Curtis) is a young teenager mourning the loss of her mother. She's moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan with her father Miles (Linus Roache) and is set to begin school at Hamilton, an exclusive prep school. Beckett is so engrossed in her grief that she fails to notice that her school is a little stranger than most schools, as its students are prone to suicides and is full of extraordinarily beautiful female teachers. 

Things grow worse when the school nurse Pamela (Kelly Reilly) decides to move in with Beckett and Miles, especially since Pamela keeps instructing Beckett to remain a virgin. What Beckett doesn't know is that Pamela and the other school staff are all incarnations of Lamia, a former queen of Libya, and must kill and drink the blood of virgins to retain their immortal existence.

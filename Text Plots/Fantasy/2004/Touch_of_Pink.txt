Alim is a young gay man, born in Kenya and raised in Toronto, Canada.  He moved to London to get away from his conservative Muslim upbringing.  When his widowed mother, Nuru, announces an unplanned visit that involves staying with him, it creates hardship in the relationship with his boyfriend Giles because they must pretend to be only flatmates, and forces Alim to deal with coming out to his mother.  Meanwhile, Alim has an imaginary friend who appears as Cary Grant, and gives Alim advice when he is in trouble; unfortunately, the advice often seems to result in more trouble.

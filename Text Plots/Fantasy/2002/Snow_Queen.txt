The film features a number of significant changes from Hans Christian Andersen's story. Most prominently is that Gerda and Kai are openly romantically attached to each other, instead of simply being friends. Another significant change is that the opening and ending sections of the film take place in a modern "realistic" setting, while Gerda and Kai's adventures are dream-like and surreal.

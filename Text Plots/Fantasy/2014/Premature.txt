Rob Crabbe is a regular, awkward high school student. On a particular day, Rob has a college-entrance interview that could change his life. As Rob wakes up from a wet dream, his mother walks into his room and asks Rob to clean his linens after she sees them stained obviously with semen. The interview is for admittance to Georgetown University (the alma mater of Rob's parents) and during the interview Jack Roth (the interviewer) bursts into tears because his wife recently died. A number of events, such as Rob's crotch being hit by another student with a water pistol and a minor bicycle/auto incident, occur to further mess up Rob's day.

An attractive classmate, Angela, gives Rob the impression that she wants to sleep with him. He visits Angela, the two kiss, and when Angela puts her hand in Rob's pants, he ejaculates prematurely and wakes up in his room, just at the same moment that his mother walks in on him. The day begins again. At first, Rob believes it all to be a dream, but after experiencing the same day several times, ending with his ejaculation, he realizes that it's not a dream. Rob then attempts to make the day different. He drives a golf cart through the school, smokes pot with his friend Gabrielle in the school bus, touches a teacher's breasts and tries to damage the water pistol, but none of it results in him escaping the time loop.

Rob eventually realizes that he's in love with Gabrielle and goes to her place to confess his feelings. Gabrielle returns his affection and the two decide to have sex. Again, Rob has a premature ejaculation, but this time he does not wake up in his room, but continues to be with Gabrielle. He realizes that he has finally broken the time loop.

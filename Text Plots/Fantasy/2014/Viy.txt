Early-18th-century cartographer Jonathan Green undertakes a scientific voyage from Western Europe to the East. Having passed through Transylvania and crossed the Carpathian Mountains, he finds himself in a small village lost in impassable woods of Ukraine. The villagers share a naive belief that they could save themselves from evil, failing to understand that an evil curse has already made its way into their town.

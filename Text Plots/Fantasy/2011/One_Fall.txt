Set in the rustic Midwestern U.S. town of One Fall, the film tells the story of a man, James (Marcus Dean Fuller), who miraculously survived a horrific fall from a spectacular 200-foot-high cliff and was never heard from again. However, three years after vanishing James chooses to return to his hometown of One Fallâ€”but he returns a changed man. For an incomprehensible reason, James has developed supernatural healing abilities. He must decide whether to use his abilities to help the ones he once turned his back on or to continue running from his mysterious past.

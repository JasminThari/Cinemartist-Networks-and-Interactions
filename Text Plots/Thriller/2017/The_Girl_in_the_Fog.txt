''The Girl in the Fog'' is a psychological thriller. It draws one into the world of its characters to question his own moral assumptions.

A 16 year old girl goes missing in an isolated region and suddenly the males of the small village are under scrutiny. 

The policeman in charge of the investigation has a track record of not letting innocence get in the way of a solid arrest, especially when the public and the media are baying for a result.

The detective's old adversary in the form of a righteous female journalist appears, just  to pile on the pressure.

A popular and  respected local high school teacher becomes the focus of his interest and a cat and mouse game ensues.  

But is the teacher really innocent - and a serial killer on the loose?

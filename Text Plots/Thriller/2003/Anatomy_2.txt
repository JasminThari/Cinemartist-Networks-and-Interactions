The Heidelberg chapter of the Anti-Hippocratic Society for unrestricted medical research has been shut down, but at a prestigious Berlin hospital the society still thrives. The young neurosurgeon Jo from Duisburg gets caught up in a research group led by doctor Mueller LaRousse, who urges his students to test their progress on themselves. Jo participates in the trials to eventually help his brother, who has Muscular Dystrophy. When Jo and some of his fellow students show some reluctance, Mueller LaRousse uses alternative means to punish them before they can give up the society to Paula Henning, who is now investigating the society for the police.

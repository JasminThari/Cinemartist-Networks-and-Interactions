The film begins with Ross Ulbricht's arrest in San Francisco in 2013. It then delves into Ross's background, portraying him as a well-educated aspiring entrepreneur living in Austin, Texas. Ross comes up with the idea for Silk Road as a way to challenge government control and regulations, believing in the idea of taking back liberty. He starts the website to allow anonymous buying and selling of illegal goods.

The movie introduces Ross Ulbricht, a charismatic and tech-savvy young man who creates the Silk Road, an underground website that facilitates the sale of illegal drugs and other contraband using cryptocurrencies. Ulbricht adopts the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" to operate the site anonymously.

Ross meets Julia, a student who becomes his lover and partner in crime. As Silk Road gains popularity, Ross makes millions by facilitating the sale of illegal items such as drugs, weapons, and identity information. However, when a Gawker article about Silk Road brings unwanted attention, law enforcement begins investigating the darknet marketplace.

DEA agent Rick Bowden, who has been reassigned to the cybercrimes unit after rehab, is tasked with investigating Silk Road. He enlists an informant to teach him about darknet activities, leading to clashes with fellow agents and strains in his personal life.

As Silk Road thrives, Ross becomes increasingly isolated from Julia and his friend Max, who express concerns about his illegal activities. Ross, operating under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, becomes a sensation on Silk Road and engages in various interactions with sellers and buyers on the website, all while maintaining a sense of invincibility.

DEA agents, including Rick, work tirelessly to track down the owner of Silk Road, leading to a sting operation orchestrated by Rick. The film portrays Ross's eventual arrest and the dismantling of Silk Road.

Throughout the movie, the personal struggles of both Ross and Rick are depicted, shedding light on their motivations and challenges. Ross's arrest has a profound impact on his relationships and the lives of those affected by Silk Road. The film touches on themes of hubris, greed, and the clash between individual freedom and law enforcement. It also explores the complexities of Ross's character and the blurred lines between the moralities of the law and the actions of its enforcers.

As the Silk Road gains notoriety, law enforcement agencies become determined to shut it down. Rick Bowden, a DEA agent, takes on the case and begins investigating Ulbricht. Bowden is portrayed as a dedicated law enforcement officer who is intent on bringing down Silk Road and its elusive operator.

Ross Ulbricht continues to manage Silk Road, amassing a substantial fortune through the illicit marketplace. He forms alliances and confronts threats from both law enforcement and rival criminals within the dark web.

The movie delves into the cat-and-mouse game between Ulbricht and Bowden, showcasing their strategies and motivations. Ulbricht's escalating paranoia and desire for control are also depicted as he becomes increasingly embroiled in criminal activities.

In the end, Ross Ulbricht is arrested and faces the legal consequences of his actions, highlighting the significant impact of Silk Road on the world of online criminal enterprises and the ongoing debate about the boundaries of individual liberty and government intervention in the digital age.

The film reaches its climax when Ulbricht is finally apprehended by law enforcement, and his true identity is revealed. He is arrested and faces a lengthy trial for drug trafficking, money laundering, and other charges related to Silk Road. During the trial, Ulbricht's defense team argues that he was framed and that he is not the true Dread Pirate Roberts.

The film also touches on the corrupt actions of some law enforcement agents involved in the case, including money laundering, obstruction of justice, and extortion. Despite these revelations, Ulbricht is ultimately found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, which was at this point downplayed.

Throughout the movie, the ethical and legal complexities of the Silk Road case are explored, raising questions about online privacy, government surveillance, and the consequences of prosecuting individuals involved in the dark web.

In 2015, Ross Ulbricht (the charismatic young tech-mastermind who unleashed the darknet website Silk Road) was found guilty of drug trafficking and money laundering. During the trial, there was no mention made of the fact that the murders he ordered happened, and meanwhile the corrupt DEA agent investigating Ulbricht (determined to bring down his billion-dollar empire) pleaded guilty to money laundering, obstruction of justice and extortion. He was sentenced to six and a half years in prison. So, on appeal, Ulbrichtâ€™s conviction was upheld while he is serving life without the possibility of parole, which was at this point downplayed.

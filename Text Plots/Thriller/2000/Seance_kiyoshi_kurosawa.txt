Koji Sato (K≈çji Yakusho) is a mild-mannered sound technician who is married to Junko (Jun Fubuki), a waitress who possesses powerful psychic abilities. Though these abilities allow her to see and communicate with spirits, they interfere in her day-to-day life and make it difficult for her to hold down a normal job. She hopes to build a business around her psychic powers, but faces a daunting task of proving her abilities to a skeptical world. When Hayakawa (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi), a young graduate student in psychology, invites her into a study of the paranormal, she leaps at the ability to demonstrate her skill as a medium.

Through Hayakawa, Junko becomes involved with the police search for a young girl kidnapped by a deranged ex-cop. But through a bizarre coincidence, the young girl escapes her captor and takes refuge in Koji's equipment case, unbeknownst to him. When the couple discover the unconscious child at their home, they devise a plan to keep her hidden, while Junko gradually leads the police to her. They reason that this will prove Junko's psychic abilities to the public, and also ensure that they are not falsely blamed for the kidnapping.

The plan quickly goes awry, however, and an accident leads to the child's death. Afterwards, Koji and Junko must try to hide their involvement in the girl's death, while being haunted by her angry spirit.

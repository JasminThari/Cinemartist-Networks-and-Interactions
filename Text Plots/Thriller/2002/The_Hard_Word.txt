The plot centers around three brothers, sophisticated armed robbers led by the shrewd Dale who work with their long-time lawyer, Frank and corrupt police to pull off the biggest heist in Australian history. Matters become complicated when Dale begins to realize that while he's been in jail his wife, Carol has been sleeping with Frank, who has schemes of his own.

The major heist is a reworking of the 1976 ''Great Bookie Robbery'', with a number of variations, including the murders of several people.

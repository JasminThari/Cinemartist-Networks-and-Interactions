During Bastille Day when most people are enjoying the French national holiday, a group of thieves prepare to commit a warehouse robbery at a massive industrial park. Meanwhile, Laborie, a special agent in the French special forces, is leading an international team that is escorting the captured leader of the Albanian mafia, Abedin Nexhep, who is due in court on charges of running an extensive European prostitution network. Despite the considerable security escort, Nexhep's henchmen still manage to set up an ambush.

Laborie manages to escape with Nexhep. They take refuge in the warehouse that is being robbed of computer equipment by the group of criminals. While facing off against the would-be thieves, the Albanian mafia surround the warehouse. Soon the three groups are involved in a long firefight with everyone involved struggling to survive.

In a return to the original film's premise, Jack Deth is back â€“ traveling back in time and into the body of his own daughter, Josephine (Zette Sullivan), on a mission to save her life and save the world from the most lethal Trancers yet. Jack / Jo must adapt and survive, avoiding many assassination attempts by more powerful and dangerous zombie-like Trancers than he's ever faced before.

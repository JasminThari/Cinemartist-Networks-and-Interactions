A teenage girl, Cee, and her father, Damon, descend from a transport spaceship to a forest moon's surface in a landing pod to mine for gems. During their descent, a technical malfunction cripples the lander, forcing them to land some distance away from their planned prospecting site. On foot, they find an abandoned dig site where they extract a fleshy pod from the earth, revealing a valuable gem inside. Cee urges her father to return to the lander with the gem, but Damon insists on continuing to the original site.

Setting out again, Damon encounters two rival prospectors, Ezra and his silent partner. Initially planning to rob Damon at gunpoint, they reconsider when Damon counter-offers to join forces. He reveals he's been asked to assist mercenaries who've discovered the legendary 'queen's lair,' an incredibly valuable dig site. Damon proposes that instead of aiding the mercenaries, he, Ezra, and the silent companion can collaborate to claim the site for themselves.

Ezra agrees to the alliance, but Cee, who has been hidden, ambushes them with a rifle. This allows Damon to disarm Ezra and take both rival prospectors hostage. When Damon tries to rob Ezra, the silent partner attacks, leading to a shootout. Ezra's partner is killed, and Damon, mortally wounded, is executed by Ezra.

Cee retreats to her malfunctioning lander, which won't start, and is found by Ezra hours later. When Ezra tries to enter, Cee shoots him in the arm and takes him captive. Ezra proposes following Damon's initial plan to assist the mercenaries for a ride on their ship. Cee agrees reluctantly, and they head for the queen's lair. Ezra's arm becomes infected from the moon's poisonous spores, prompting them to seek medical help from local villagers. The villagers propose trading gems for Cee instead. As Ezra inquires about the deal, Cee escapes, pursued by the villagers.

After wandering alone, Cee encounters Ezra again, his wound severely worsened. She helps him amputate his arm and they proceed to a mercenary camp near the queen's lair. After securing a ride on the mercenaries' ship, they try and fail multiple times to extract gems. When their guard moves to report their failure, Ezra kills him, triggering a fight with the remaining mercenaries. Several are killed, and Ezra sustains grave injuries. Cee tends to his wounds, and they escape into orbit aboard the mercenaries' ship.

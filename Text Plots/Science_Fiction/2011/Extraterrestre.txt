Julio (Julián Villagrán) wakes up one morning in an apartment, unable to remember what happened the night before.  He barely has a chance to speak to the girl he spent the previous evening with, Julia (Michelle Jenner), when it becomes clear there is an alien spacecraft hanging over the city.

Before long they discover that the next-door neighbor Ángel (Carlos Areces) who has a crush on Julia and Julia's boyfriend Carlos (Raúl Cimas) are both alive.

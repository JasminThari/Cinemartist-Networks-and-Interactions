Emilia, a troubled art student living in London, believes her mother does not care about her. As a result, they have a terrible relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/reviews/2-film/4124-franklyn-film-review.html|title=FRANKLYN (Film Review)|access-date=2 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007234340/http://fangoria.com/reviews/2-film/4124-franklyn-film-review.html|archive-date=7 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In a reality completely different from Emilia's, Jonathan Preest is the masked vigilante of Meanwhile City, a place where everyone is legally enforced to adopt a religion. Preest, the only atheist in town, learns that his nemesis, The Individual, has kidnapped a girl. While looking for her, he is captured by the local authorities. Promising to eventually release him, they bring Preest to an operating room to implant a homing device on him. Before they can do that, Preest fights his way out of the building.

In Emilia's world, during one of her arts projects, she records herself calling an ambulance and taking a deadly amount of pills. The ambulance arrives in time to save her, and she wakes up in a hospital.

In that same building, Peter, a man steeped in religion, is looking for his son David, who has become mentally unstable after returning from the war. He has been reported to be at that hospital before fleeing.<ref name="FilmFour">{{cite journal|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=169067&section=review |title=Franklyn Movie Review |journal=FilmFour |accessdate=15 January 2009 }}</ref>

After learning that the kidnapped girl has been killed by the Individual, Preest visits Wormsnake, his usual informant, and attacks him. With the excuse of wanting to arrange a meeting to talk things out, Preest gives Wormsnake a note with an address and tells him to give it to the Individual. He then hides in the building in front of the one referenced in the note and prepares his sniper rifle while awaiting the Individual.

Another one of Emilia's projects is following and recording strangers in secret, occasionally wearing a red wig as a disguise. One of the strangers, Milo, is a thirty something whose fianc√©e left him days before the wedding. Heartbroken, Milo starts believing an old friend from childhood, a red-haired woman named Sally, is everywhere he goes. He eventually talks to Sally, who looks a lot like Emilia, and arranges for a date at a restaurant. Milo later learns from his mother that Sally is imaginary; a character he constructed as a child while dealing with the death of his father. He nonetheless decides to go to the restaurant the night of the date.

At a shelter for the homeless, Peter meets Bill, an old acquaintance of David from his time in Basra. David recently attacked Bill and gave him a piece of paper with an address. Bill, who looks a lot like Wormsnake, fears David will kill him.

After a conversation with the hospital's religious janitor and another botched suicide attempt, Emilia decides to confront her mother. It turns out that, as a child, Emilia was abused by her father and told her mother about it. For her entire life, Emilia has thought that her mother did not believe her. Her mother reveals that she did believe Emilia, and that is why they left her father. The two women hug and reconcile.

Peter goes to the address in the piece of paper, which turns out to be the building where Emilia lives. Baffled, he decides to go to the restaurant in front of the building, the same where Milo is "dating" Sally.

David, who is Preest in the alternate reality, breaks into Emilia's apartment, hits her and uses her window to aim a rifle at his father in the restaurant below. In yet another suicide attempt, Emilia turns on a gas heater. It turns out that the Meanwhile City reality is a fantasy constructed by David after the trauma of both the war and losing his sister at a young age. When she died, Peter told David that her death was part of God's plan, in an attempt to reasure him. Peter's attitude had the opposite effect on David, who has resented his father ever since. Believing himself to be a hero, he shoots at the exact moment that Milo stands up to "kiss" Sally. The bullet ends up hitting Milo and makes everyone in the restaurant panic. Realizing what he has actually done, David commits suicide by igniting the gas causing an explosion that destroys the apartment. Emilia, who was running out of the apartment, is blown clear; she leaves the building and is spotted by Milo. As the paramedics arrive on the scene, Milo and Emilia meet and start talking.

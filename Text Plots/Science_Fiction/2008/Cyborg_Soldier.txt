I.S.A.A.C. (Intuitive Synthetic Autonomous Assault Commando), played by former UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin, is the first prototype of a secret "human weapon" program. Once a death-row inmate, he is now a genetically reconstructed, highly trained, deadly assassin whose body and mind have been modified to become a physically regenerative, intellectually superior human being.

While on the run, I.S.A.A.C. takes Deputy Lindsay Rearden (Tiffani Thiessen; ''Beverly Hills, 90210'') hostage. Their lives are in jeopardy from military agents being led by robotics engineer Simon Hart (Bruce Greenwood; ''I, Robot''; ''National Treasure: Book of Secrets''). Deputy Reardon and I.S.A.A.C. work together to expose the military group constructing the super beings.

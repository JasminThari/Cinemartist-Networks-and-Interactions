It has been a couple of years since Tu defeated Slash. Tu is now regarded as the protector of the village, defeating bandits and upholding justice. However, with no skills, Tu has to start training to harness the kung fu skills he inherited from the grandmaster. One day, Fu rescues an old injured warrior who turns out to be the evil Zhan. Zhan is badly injured and Fu decides to keep him safe because Zhan told him that he is in danger. This is just a plan as Zhan plans to take over the world of martial arts by acquiring a martial of fire from Lan of Huell Clan. Lan is the leader of Huell clan, who are the guardians of Martial of fire, and nobody can cross the barrier between martial and the temple of fire. Zhane fools Tu because only Tu, after getting the powers of Grandmaster Ape, can cross the barrier. Fu fails to save Laun and the martial of fire, and realizes he is just a lucky rabbit who happened to inherit the grandmaster's kung fu, but Penny encourages him to practice and go for it. He starts to practice hard with Laun and Penny, as they both know kung fu very well. Becky is also eventually able to join them in stopping Zhan's evil plan, as Becky has been thrown in a valley by Zhane. This finally makes Fu able to overthrow Zhan by holding the true harmony of the martial of fire.

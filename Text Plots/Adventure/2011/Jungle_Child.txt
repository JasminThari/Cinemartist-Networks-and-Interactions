Klaus Kuegler is a linguist and travels with his wife Doris and his three children into the tropical rainforest of Western New Guinea, Indonesia in 1979 to explore the language of a newly discovered native tribe, the Fayu. The eight-year-old daughter Sabine quickly settles down. What the family does not know: It has come in the midst of a tribal feud whose battles they do not directly affect, but in which they are increasingly drawn into it. The family does not find it easy at first to understand the reason for the hostilities, and it must realize that love, hate, life and death have different values in the foreign culture than in their own. So begins a process of rapprochement in which both sides have to learn from each other.

One day, when Sabine and her brother find the severely injured Auri and the family feeds him at home, they endanger everyone, as this action can decide on war and peace between the two tribes. Sabine and Auri immediately develop a special bond and deep friendship.

When the family travels to Germany for a holiday after spending years, the sixteen-year-old Sabine is confronted with a completely "foreign" world that is no longer hers. Their search for belonging and security ultimately becomes a search for themselves.  Only after returning to the jungle does she know where her true home is.

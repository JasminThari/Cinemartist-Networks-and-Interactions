Doctor Island (Joe Morton) has invented a computer microchip he plans to use to train dogs instantly. However, his former colleague, Doctor Wagner (Craig Ferguson), has other plans for the microchip: he wants to implant copies in every child in order to brainwash them to come work for him after they turn 18, and be exceedingly loyal. In the fight between Doctor Island and Doctor Wagner's henchmen, Hanky (Andrew Shaifer), Panky (Jeff Chase), and Doctor Island get injured and his dog Lenny (Andy Richter) is injected with the computer microchip. On the run, Lenny finds his brainpower growing. And when he finds a young boy, Zach (Sammy Kahn), to be his friend and savior, Lenny discovers he can talk. Lenny (continually amazed by the new powers the embedded microchip keeps giving him), Zach (full of unrequited love for longtime friend Becky), and school newspaper reporter Becky (Stephanie Sherrin) (out to write the story of the century) team up with downtrodden police officer John Wyndham (Michael Winslow) to defeat Dr. Wagner and his henchmen. The showdown culminates at the school concert given by Pop Star Angie (Maria de los Angeles Monasterio), where Zach's inspiring speech and Lenny's audio powers combine to incriminate Doctor Wagner, who is arrested by the police chief, now appreciative of Officer Wyndham's talents for police-work and crime-solving.

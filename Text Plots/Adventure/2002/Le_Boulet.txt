Moltès, a killer in prison, plays the lottery every week and sends the tickets with Reggio, a guard, so that the latter's wife, Pauline, can have them validated. One day the ticket is a winner, but Pauline is at a car rally in Africa, unknowingly carrying the ticket with her. Moltès wanting to recover his due, escapes and forces Reggio (the guard) to accompany him. However, he becomes the target of his nemesis, another gangster nicknamed "The Turk" (whose brother was killed by Moltès), and his bodyguard named Requin, a giant with teeth of steel.

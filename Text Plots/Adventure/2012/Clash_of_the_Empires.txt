The film is about a prehistoric struggle between a community of Homo floresiensis (known as "hobbits") and their brutal oppressors, Java Man ("Java Men"). The hobbits ally with early humans against the Javas. According to The Asylum, "In an ancient age, the small, peace-loving hobbits are enslaved by the Java Men, a race of flesh-eating dragon-riders. The young hobbit Goben must join forces with their neighbor giants, the humans, to free his people and vanquish their enemies."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blastr.com/2012/11/warner-bros-officially-tr.php |title=Warner Bros. officially trying to kill that hobbit mockbuster |author=Moore, Trent |website=blastr |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115233302/http://blastr.com/2012/11/warner-bros-officially-tr.php |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

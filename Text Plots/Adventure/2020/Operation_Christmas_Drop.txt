Erica, a congressional assistant in Washington, DC, is tasked with investigating a US Air Force base in Guam. The ultimate goal is to find a reason to justify its closure.

Andrew is the Air Force captain chosen to show Erica around the USAF base to convince her that it should remain open. She arrives two hours earlier than expected, then ditches him at her first opportunity to try to explore on her own.

The base has a yearly tradition of airlifting goods to the small islands of Micronesia for Christmas. Andrew shows Erica around the base and various islands, explaining how they gather local donations of food and money, proving that the base's resources, thus American  tax dollars, are not being spent here. 

An example is given of how a shipment of 10 fir trees arrive there at no cost. Andrew's Oregon friend donated the trees, and they come via several connections through military flights. The trees are traded in a Guam hotel for sheets and food donations.

At the base's big solar-powered fundraising event, the rest of Erica's skepticism dissipates and she and Andrew have a moment. The next day, as the care packages are being assembled, news of a serious typhoon comes to Guam. The planes are grounded, but Erica tells them to keep the faith.

The weather clears, and Erica opts to disobey her congresswoman's orders to head back to Washington. Just before the planes are set to take off, she shows up to again insist she leave. Erica stands up to her, suggesting she also participate. The experience inspires her, revitalizing her Christmas spirit and demonstrating that the tradition is worthwhile and the base should not be closed. 

Romance between Erica and Andrew blooms during these events.

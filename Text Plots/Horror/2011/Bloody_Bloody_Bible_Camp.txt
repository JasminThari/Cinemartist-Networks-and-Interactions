In 1977, a group of young people are massacred at the hands of Sister Mary Chopper at the Happy Day Bible Camp. Only two people survive the slaughter, Millie and Dwayne, the latter of whom was left with brain damage. Seven years later, Father Richard Cummings leads a group of teenagers to the camp, despite warnings from a concerned local about the camp, now dubbed 'Bloody Bloody Bible Camp'. Accompanying Father Cummings is Millie, who is keeping her past history with the camp a secret despite her ongoing trauma over the event. Eventually, Sister Mary Chopper resumes her slaughter, eventually leaving only Father Cummings and goth camper Jennifer alive. Father Cummings has a near death experience where he meets Jesus, who tells him that while it's OK to be homosexual, it isn't OK that he brought the teenagers here and that he must save the camp. It's revealed that the killer is actually Eugene, a goth local who had been at a convenience store that the campers had stopped at earlier in the film. Tormented by an abusive nun who raised him as a girl and led him to believe that sin must be physically punished with death, Father Cummings manages to defeat Sister Mary Chopper and bring an end to the chaos.

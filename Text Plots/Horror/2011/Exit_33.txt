While drunk and out hunting one day, Ike accidentally shot his pregnant wife in the eye, and since then he has been coerced by hallucinations or ghosts of his wife and unborn son into atoning for the act by acquiring replacement eyes. Whenever a woman he finds suitable stops at his gas station on Exit 33, Ike has them use a sabotaged pump that causes their vehicle to break down a short distance away. Ike then drives up, kills anyone with the woman, knocks her out and takes her back to the gas station, where he gouges out their eyes, and makes jerky out of their body. Ike preserves the eyes, and places them in one of the mounted hunting trophies in his den.

While on their way to their fifth high school reunion, Angie and Eve (whose boyfriend is beheaded with a hacksaw) are captured by Ike, who removes both of Eve's eyes and lets her exsanguinate. Every time a possible savior (such as Angie's boyfriend Matt, a pair of hunters, and an off-duty police officer) stop by, they are killed by Ike, who loses an eye himself during a fight with Matt. Angie's eyes are inevitably removed, and Ike places them in one of his hunting trophies. While relaxing in his den, Ike tells his imaginary son that he hopes next hunting season will be just as fruitful as this one.

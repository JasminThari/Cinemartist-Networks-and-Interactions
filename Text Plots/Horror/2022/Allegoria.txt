Delving into the uncharted depths of artistic creation, "Allegoria" explores the restless torment of human creativity and the dark corridors of an artist's soul: a haunting place populated by the fiery demons of inspiration. With this in mind, young drama student Brody takes the stage to communicate her deeper emotions, taking the term "visual rhetoric" too far. Next up, tortured painter Marcus receives unexpected support from an otherworldly benefactor willing to help him meet a deadline. Following, self-applauding screenwriter Eddie has finished writing a bloody scene for his slasher movie. But as one thing leads to another, he witnesses first-hand what true evil looks like. Then, shy John can't believe his eyes when his beautiful sculptor date Ivy comes over for a drink. However, looks can be deceiving, and John is about to discover that art imitates life. Lastly, Brody's rock singer roommate Hope dabbles in the supernatural, playing with fire and forces far beyond her understanding.

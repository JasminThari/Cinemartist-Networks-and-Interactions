Eric is a land surveyor that has been sent out to assess a forest in Dublin. His employer is vague on the exact reasons for the survey, but Eric willingly goes on the assignment in order to get away from his family. It also allows Eric to spend more time with his student assistant Olivia, as the two are engaged in an extramarital affair and their assignment will leave them in almost complete seclusion from the outside world. Once arrived, strange occurrences and malfunctioning equipment begin to cause Eric's mind to unravel.

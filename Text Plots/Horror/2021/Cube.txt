A man wakes up in a mysterious and cold cube-shaped room. He finds hatches on each side, leading to different rooms. Upon entering a room, he is suddenly impaled by a large metal square, which retracts, taking out a square chunk from his body.

Three people, Goto, Uno, and Ochi wake up in a mysterious room. None of them can seem to recall how or why they got here. A woman, Kai, enters the room, as well as a man named Ide. They all have no memory or recollection of how they got here. Ochi, out of fear tries to escape, but Ide warns him there are traps as he tosses a boot into the room, setting off flamethrowers. Confirming to the others that each room is trapped by certain sensors, Ide takes charge and begins leading the others through the numerous rooms; discovering clues as to the structure's layout. After crossing several rooms, they encounter another man named Ando who wound up under similar circumstances and first thinks they are a rescue squad. Together, they all manage to escape another trap that tries to kill them.

Father Peter, a prestigious exorcist, teams up with Father Daniel, a young and inexperienced priest, on his first day of work. They try to stop the demonic possession of a young boy named Charlie.

While performing the exorcism on Charlie and seeing his arms slowly burn, Father Daniel realizes that Father Peter is actually possessed, and in a struggle, Father Daniel kills Father Peter.

Later on, the archbishop and Father Daniel realize every priest who has worked under Father Peter has been possessed by a demon, creating a network of demonic priests that is quite sizable.

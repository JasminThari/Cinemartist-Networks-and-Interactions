During a tornado, teenager Melissa, her parents Robert and Diane, and her brother, Bobby, gather in the bathroom.

A tree crashes through the house, blocking the door and trapping the family. They see a snake outside. Tensions rise as they await help. Alcoholic Robert becomes irate as he suffers withdrawal.

A dog appears outside, off screen. As the children pet it without looking, it proclaims in a male voice  that it's a "good boy" and bites Melissa, who rips its tongue out by the root. Diane rinses off the tongue, and the family eats it.

Flashbacks show Melissa with her girlfriend, Amy. The pair are filmed kissing by Amy's stalker, Joe, and are frustrated by the gossip of bullies. Amy casts a spell on Joe, requiring Melissa to dig up the family dog in the backyard and take his tongue. Joe dies. Amy thinks the spell messed up because she had something inside her.

The snake reappears and bites Bobby. Off-screen, men enter the house and shoot or are shot by a monster. Bobby dies of the bite. Melissa tells her parents she and Amy caused the supernatural events with the failed spell. 

Robert, delirious from withdrawal and alcoholic wipes, says they must eat Bobby. He answers a call on Melissa's phone and throws the phone back outside. He screams about witches and beats Diane with a snake. Melissa stabs him to death with a piece of mirror.

Diane breaks through the brick wall and leaves. Melissa wakes up and has a vision of Amy attacking her. Diane returns covered in blood. The two scream as something crashes in or just outside the bathroom.

A year after the previous events, the Wishbone family is struggling with its various shortcomings. Max, the son, is the shortest student in the 8th grade. All the classmates are at least a head taller, so they laugh at the clumsy fat man with glasses.{{Clarify|date=July 2022}} His sister Faye believes all her friends are talented in something, but she is not. The mother, Emma, tries to help her children, but her advice is ignored at best and often irritates them. Finally, the father Frank's happiness at his new job and calmer lifestyle is being ruined because his family is so unhappy.

At the wedding of the witch Baba Yaga and the hunchbacked butler Renfield (who have become part of the large Wishbone family as surrogate grandparents), the bride and groom are kidnapped shortly before they exchange oaths. The kidnapper is Mila Starr, the only daughter of a billionaire, scientific genius and philanthropist, couple Marlene and Maddox Starr. To save Baba Yaga and Renfield, Max intentionally uses Baba Yaga's magic to turn himself and his family into their monster forms again. Now the transformed Wishbone family must rescue Baba Yaga and Renfield from the Starr family while also encountering the Starr family's trapped monsters, including their old enemy Count Dracula.

A college professor and a clique of hikers embark on a quest for an archaic Indian burial ground in the woods. Upon stumbling across what is most likely the searched for spot, three members of the squad turn against the rest and restrain them in order to ransack the gravesite.

In due course, one of the looters comes upon a crown that unleashes a monster that commences a killing spree which sends the party into a frenzy for their lives.

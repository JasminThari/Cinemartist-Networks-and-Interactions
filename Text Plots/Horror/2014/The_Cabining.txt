Todd and his feckless friend want nothing more than to write a hit horror screenplay. Todd’s wealthy uncle offers to fund the feature, but he provides one condition - they must complete it in two weeks.

With the accelerated deadline, Todd and Bruce venture to a remote artists’ retreat, hoping for inspiration. When guests start dying in mysterious, gruesome ways, Todd can’t help but be equally revolted and inspired.

With his imagination piqued, Todd must write quickly before he becomes the next victim.

Dr. Henry Moorehouse (Robert Brettenaugh) is obsessively determined to find a universal cure for disease. He plans on doing this with an organism known only as 'Ella', a large parasite which he claims can successfully create a vaccine for any virus it's exposed to. Gemma (Alexandra Bard) is Henryâ€™s assistant, who claims to have personally witnessed him going from being a genius doctor to an insane vampiric creature after an experiment gone awry.

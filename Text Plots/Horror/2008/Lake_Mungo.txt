Sixteen-year-old Alice Palmer drowns while swimming with her family at a dam in Ararat, Australia. Her older brother Mathew sets up video cameras around the house to record what seem to be images of Alice's ghost. They consult psychic Ray Kemeney for insight on the apparent haunting, but he is unable to explain. Mathew confesses he set up the "sightings" of his dead sister to give the family reason to exhume her body and give his mother closure, but one of the hoax videos also captures Alice's bedroom being searched by Brett Toohey, a neighbor for whom Alice had worked as a babysitter. After her own search of the bedroom, Alice's mother June finds a hidden videotape showing Alice in a sexual encounter with Brett and his wife.

Ray admits that Alice met with him several months before her death and told him she was having dreams about drowning, being dead, and her mother being unable to see or help her. Alice's boyfriend comes forward with mobile phone footage of a school trip to Lake Mungo, where Alice is shown burying something at the base of a tree. The Palmers travel to Lake Mungo and find the tree, where they dig up her phone. The footage on the phone shows her walking along the lake's shore and encountering a ghostly, corpse-like doppelg√§nger of herself with a bloated and disfigured face, appearing just as her body would later be found in the lake.

The Palmers move out of their house, feeling that Alice wanted them to know who she really was and what she had seen. They now believe the haunting has ended and Alice's ghost has moved on. In a photograph of their last moments at the house, a cloudy figure that may be Alice appears to be in a window. The photographs that Mathew admitted to faking also appear to show Alice in other parts of the frame.

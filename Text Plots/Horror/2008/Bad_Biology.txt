The film follows Jennifer, a photographer, and Batz. Jennifer has an over-evolved, hyperactive reproduction system. Because of her condition, she can only be satisfied by very intense sex, which occasionally results in the death of her partners.

Jennifer's co-worker offers to get access to a mansion for a special photo shoot. Meanwhile, at said mansion, Batz is trying to subdue his sentient penis, which is addicted to drugs. Batz sees one of the models during the shoot, and gets an erection. Jennifer witnesses this and becomes obsessed with him, convinced that he is the only man who can satisfy her. She steals his house keys and later breaks into his house. She sees him bring home a prostitute and begins to film it.

Although his sexual encounter with the prostitute does not last long, she continues to orgasm for more than forty-five minutes afterwards. Jennifer gets aroused by this, and returns the next night, only to discover that Batz's penis has left his body, and is having sex with numerous women throughout the city.

The penis eventually returns; however, it is suffering from withdrawal, and slowly dying. Batz wants to let it die, because he is sick of taking care of it, but Jennifer begins to give it the drug, rejuvenating it, and causing Batz to overdose. The penis enters Jennifer and she has an orgasm. The penis falls out of Jennifer, dead, and she collapses. She then gives birth to a half-human, half-penis mutant baby before dying.

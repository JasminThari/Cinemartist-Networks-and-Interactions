After a night of hard-partying, a group of college students decide to try their hands at a seance by using a homemade Ouija board. Things take a turn for the worse when they end up summoning a djinn that soon begins to hunt down and lead each one of the students towards untimely deaths.

To stop the djinn, Liam, desperate for the sake of his friends, will have to face his fear of the supernatural; even if it means paying the ultimate price.

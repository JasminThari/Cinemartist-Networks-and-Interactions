Fuad Ramses III returns to Miami to reopen his grandfather's defunct catering company. This arouses the interest of the local sheriff, who holds Fuad's family reputation in ill favor. Fuad is soon, however, asked to cater the sheriff's wedding by his mother-in-law, Mrs. Lampley, and fiancee, Tiffani. After finding his grandfather's statue of Ishtar, an Egyptian Babylonian goddess, in a utility closet, he becomes possessed by her evil spirit. He then goes on to create the 'blood feast' his grandfather failed to do, by targeting Tiffani's six bridesmaids: Bambi, Misti, Brandi, Trixie, Candi and Laci and making them into party food for the wedding.

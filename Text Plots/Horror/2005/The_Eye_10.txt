Chong-kwai welcomes his friends Ted, May, Kofei and April from Hong Kong to his home in Thailand. He shows them a book which describes a game of ten ways to see ghosts.

After Kofei goes missing halfway during the game after he relieved himself on a tree in the woods, April stays behind in Thailand to try to find him, while Ted and May return to Hong Kong. April disappears too later.

Back in Hong Kong, Ted and May continue to encounter ghosts. Chong-kwai returns to the shop where he bought the book and learns that he and his friends have been cursed and they need to finish the game.

Ted and May return to Thailand and play the last part of the game. They enter a ghostly dimension and finally find Kofei. They also meet April, who has committed suicide after thinking that Kofei is dead. Kofei stays behind with April while Ted and May attempt to escape, but they end up trapped in another ghostly dimension.

;The Ten Ways
There are ten ways listed in the film by which one may observe a ghost:
# Getting a corneal transplant from a person who can see ghosts (as seen in ''The Eye'')
# Attempting suicide while pregnant (as seen in ''The Eye 2'')
# Playing ouija or a similar game
# Tapping chopsticks on a bowl and offering food at a road intersection at night to attract hungry ghosts
# Playing hide-and-seek at night while carrying a black cat
# Rubbing dirt from a grave on your eyes
# Opening an umbrella under shelter
# Brushing your hair at midnight in front of a mirror
# Bending over to look back between your legs
# Sleeping in used traditional garments for the deceased

Ed Gein is a socially awkward farmer who lives alone on the outskirts of Plainfield, Wisconsin. Ed, despondent over the recent death of his overbearing mother, has begun digging up and "borrowing" the bodies of women who remind him of her with the reluctant help of his only friend, Jack. In 1957, Ed suffers a psychotic break and becomes a spree killer, murdering a stranded motorist named Becky, Jack, and a graveyard security guard before abducting a bartender named Sue Layton. Ed butchers Sue in his barn and uses her flesh to construct a "woman suit" before kidnapping another woman, a hardware store owner named Vera Mason.

Vera's son, Deputy Bobby Mason, is away in another county with his girlfriend, Erica, when he receives word of Vera's disappearance. While rushing back to Plainfield, Bobby crashes his car, and when he goes off in search of aid, the wounded Erica is taken by Ed. Bobby regroups with the rest of the Plainfield police force shortly after a witness comes forward to report seeing what looked like a woman's feet dangling from the back of Ed's truck. The police search Ed's home, and find what is left of Sue and Vera. Bobby vows to kill Ed, who has run off with Erica.

In the woods, Erica tries to appeal to Ed's humanity, asking if he has any compassion, with Ed dourly answering that his compassion died with his parents and brother before expressing the nihilistic beliefs that life is worthless because it inevitably ends and that "we're all just flesh." Bobby saves Erica from Ed, who he contemplates killing, only to be talked out of it by the sheriff and Erica. An intertitle then states that Ed was charged with two of the ten murders that he was accused of, but was found unfit to stand trial and spent the rest of his life in a mental institution, where he died of cancer in 1984.

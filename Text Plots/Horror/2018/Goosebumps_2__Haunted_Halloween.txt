Three years after the previous movie, teenager Sarah Quinn lives with her mother, Kathy, and younger brother, Sonny, in Wardenclyffe, New York. Sonny and his friend Sam Carter find a locked manuscript in an abandoned house and open it, causing Slappy the Dummy to appear. The manuscript is stolen by bully Tommy Madigan.

At home, Slappy reveals that he is alive to the boys. After he causes several accidents and incidents, the kids realize Slappy is at fault. They try to dispose of him but he escapes. They find an article online about the events that happened in Madison, Delaware and contact R. L. Stine, who departs for Wardenclyffe.

Slappy uses his magic to bring ''Goosebumps'' costumes and Halloween decorations to life and transforms a store employee named Walter into a hunchbacked ogre. Sarah, Sonny, and Sam retrieve the book from Tommy's house and discover that the book can trap the monsters inside. Kathy is kidnapped by the monsters. The kids' neighbor, Mr. Chu, a ''Goosebumps'' fan, helps them craft monster disguises to safely navigate the town.

The kids head for the Wardenclyffe Tower, where Slappy is. They discover that Slappy has turned Kathy into a living dummy. They defeat Slappy and Sarah combines the book's power with the tower reactor's energy to drag all the other monsters back into the manuscript, returning Kathy and Walter to normal. Stine congratulates the kids for defeating the monsters.

Kathy and Walter start dating. Sonny wins the school science fair and Sarah gets accepted into Columbia University. Back in Stine's cabin, Slappy, who survived, appears, revealing he has written a book of his own where Stine is the main character. He opens his manuscript, sucking Stine inside.

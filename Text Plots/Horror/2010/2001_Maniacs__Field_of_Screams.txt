When this year's round of unsuspecting Northerners fail to show up for their annual Guts Nâ€™ Glory Jubilee because the Feds are investigating the disappearances of Northerners over the years, the residents of Pleasant Valley take their twisted carnival on the road and head to Iowa, where they encounter spoiled heiresses, Rome and Tina Sheraton, and the cast and crew of their ''Road Rascals'' reality show. They begin killing the cast and crew.

At the end, the residents of Pleasant Valley get an idea to use a TV commercial to lure in their victims.

A brother and sister are on the run, determined to keep their incestuous relationship a secret. While hiding deep in a forest, among many traps and landmines, the siblings are not alone: the park ranger, his wife and dog; four friends on their way to have a game of tennis; two police officers; and a serial killer. They all encounter each other in various ways, but not all of them will survive.

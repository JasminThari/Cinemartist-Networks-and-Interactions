Several teenagers go out into the woods in order to have fun, drink alcohol, and smoke pot. While out there, Teddy (Mike Johnson) begins to tell the others stories about the old chemical plant. Years ago an explosion caused the closure of the plant and the body of the plant's night operator was never found. Teddy claims that he read in his grandfather's journal that there is a manbeast in the woods that would mutilate livestock. The group decides to travel to the old chemical plant to check it out, only to discover that there is something dangerous living there.

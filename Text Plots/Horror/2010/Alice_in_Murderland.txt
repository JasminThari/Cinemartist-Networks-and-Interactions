Twenty-year-old Alice Lewis is turning 21, and is upset about it. Her sorors want to cheer her up and decide to hold a birthday party with an ''Alice in Wonderland'' theme at Charlene Glass's house. Alice knows that in the basement of that house, her mother, Ann Lewis, was brutally hacked to death by a masked killer 20 years before. The girls set a rule that no cell phones and no boys will be allowed.

Everyone comes dressed as their favorite character from the film. Someone who was not invited comes as the Jabberwocky (a fierce creature from the book) and brings mayhem to the girls' night, as he starts murdering them one by one while the party is taking place.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moviefone.com/movie/alice-in-murderland/10053572/synopsis |title=Moviefone.com |access-date=August 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115143535/http://www.moviefone.com/movie/alice-in-murderland/10053572/synopsis |archive-date=January 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

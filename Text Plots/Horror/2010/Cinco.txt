The film is divided into five parts entitled "Braso" ({{literal translation|Arm}}), "Paa" ({{literal translation|Feet}}), "Mata" ({{literal translation|Eyes}}), "Mukha" ({{literal translation|Face}}), and "Puso" ({{literal translation|Heart}}), which all revolve around a hand with an "R.I.P" tattoo.

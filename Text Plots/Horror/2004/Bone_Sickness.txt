Alex McNetti (Rich George) has a rare disease which gives him very brittle bones. His friend Thomas Granger (Brian Paulin) believes that he has found the cure by feeding his friend dead flesh to counteract the terrible disease. However the process does have its side effects including making Alex cough up and vomit worms, and also turning him into a zombie. The dead start to rise from their graves and butcher every living human they see to pieces, including a heavily armed SWAT team, as well as two street hardened security guards who have been working the beat for so long they forget to take their hats off.  The zombies later invade a populated city, killing every living person in sight.

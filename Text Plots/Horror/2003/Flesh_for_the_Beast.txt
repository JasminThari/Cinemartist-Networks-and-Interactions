A group of parapsychologists are called in to investigate a mansion with a reputation for being haunted, as it was previously a brothel where many men went missing. One of the investigators, Erin Cooper (Jane Scarlett) finds herself particularly drawn to the place. As the night progresses the group discovers that they are not alone and that three succubi inhabit the house, imprisoned by a warlock's amulet. The amulet would give its user the ability to control the succubi, giving them extreme amounts of power. The succubi kill the group members one by one as the group tries desperately to discover the amulet's whereabouts and perform a ritual that would stop the succubi. The survivors are eventually pared down to two people, one of which finds the amulet but is killed while trying to begin the ritual. The survivor, Erin, is then revealed to have been a succubus all along. She had been the warlock's favorite and somehow had lost her memories and gained the ability to leave the mansion. Erin then rejoins the other succubi in the mansion.

After they each fail their audition for Jesus in a play, a Jew, a militant African American, a feminist, and a bisexual hippie go on a road trip.  On the way, they confront hostile Elvis impersonators and end up in a fight.  Fleeing the law, they end up in an intolerant religious community that holds the secret of the apocalypse; a botched magical spell reveals it to be a zombie apocalypse.  Zombies kill everyone but Jessie, who lives among them and decides to study their culture.

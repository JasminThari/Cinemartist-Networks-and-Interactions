Minami, reluctant to murder Ozaki, unwittingly kills him when he pushes him to the ground in an attempt to stop him from killing an innocent woman who he mistook for an assassin. After finding the road he was driving along mysteriously replaced with a large lake, he enters a coffee shop to find a phone. Minami is given a complimentary meal that makes him violently throw up in the bathroom and returns to discover that Ozaki's body is missing. When he asks the people in the town, he finds most of them apprehensive and uncooperative. He then sets out to explore the nearly-deserted, run-down suburb of Nagoya in a desperate attempt to recover the body, only to find himself caught in a series of increasingly surreal situations. He meets several strange characters including an elderly innkeeper obsessed with her breast milk, her strange brother who can supposedly channel spirits, a waiter who died three years ago in a car accident and ''gozu'' or a man with a cow's head, who appears to him in a dream.<ref name=":1" /> Minami tracks Ozaki to a junk yard, where he is told that he was murdered and turned into a skin suit. He returns to his car to find a girl (Yoshino) who claims to be Ozaki. After sharing intimate details of their life, as well as one of his dreams, he believes her.<ref name=":0" />

Minami and the female Ozaki spend the night at a hotel. During the night, Minami hears what sounds like a voice emanating from the female Ozaki’s vagina while she sleeps. She wakes up and asks Minami if he wants to have sex with her; he rejects her advances.

The next day, Minami drives the female Ozaki back to his gang’s office, with the intent of explaining the situation to his boss. However, once they arrive, the female Ozaki claims that she is actually the daughter of another yakuza family’s deceased boss, and that she wishes to start working for Minami’s boss.

The boss takes the female Ozaki to his office to have sex with her, leaving Minami outside. The boss inserts the handle of a ladle into his anus, as this is apparently the only way he can achieve an erection. Minami sneaks back into the office, and confronts his boss; in the ensuing physical altercation, the boss falls backwards, impaling himself on the ladle achieving orgasm. Minami electrocutes the unconscious boss with exposed wires from a light fitting, then leaves with the female Ozaki.

Minami and the female Ozaki return to Minami’s home. Minami gives in to his temptations, and at the behest of the female Ozaki, they begin to have sex. However, as soon as he penetrates her, something latches onto his penis from within the female Ozaki; as Minami recoils in horror, a human hand emerges from the female Ozaki’s vagina. The original male Ozaki then extricates himself from the female Ozaki as Minami cowers in the corner of the room.

In the final scene of the movie, Minami and the male Ozaki, along with the female Ozaki, are seen walking down the street together, arms linked.

In 1963, the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, suffers a severe drought. In a tent, a boy preacher claims that a god, whom he calls "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" has spoken to him in his dreams. He tells the other children.

Twelve years later, a bickering couple, Burt and his wife Vicky, are driving near Gatlin, planning their second honeymoon. A boy named Joseph stumbles out of the roadside corn in front of their car.  Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase. He and Vicky drive off searching for aid.
Reaching the town, Burt and Vicky find it seemingly abandoned, except for the children.

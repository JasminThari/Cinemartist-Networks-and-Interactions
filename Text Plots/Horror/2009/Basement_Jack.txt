A few years ago Jack Riley finally snapped and killed his abusive mother. After killing his mother he went from house to house killing entire families and arranging their bodies in poses that would suggest a happy home life. Jack was just a teenager when all of this happened so of course he didn’t go to jail, but he just got out of his institution and he’s out to finish what he started while a vengeful woman wants to make him pay.

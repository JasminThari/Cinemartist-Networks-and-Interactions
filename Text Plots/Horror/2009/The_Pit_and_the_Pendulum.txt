Seven students answer an advertisement to participate in an experiment to explore how the sensation of pain can be eliminated. Arriving at a secluded institute, they are welcomed by mysterious and eccentric scientist JB Divay (Lorielle New). But when students begin to disappear one by one, they begin to question JB's true intentions. In a final showdown, Jason (Stephen Hansen) confronts her and discovers his boyfriend Kyle (Bart Voitila) strapped to a table beneath her final experiment, inches away from the razor's edge.

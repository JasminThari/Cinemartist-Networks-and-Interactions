A highly infectious virus, known as "The World Ender Virus", has spread worldwide, killing most of the population. Brothers Brian and Danny, along with Brian's girlfriend Bobby and Danny's friend Kate, plot a trip to take shelter at Turtle Beach, Texas, the brothers' childhood vacation home. To help them survive, they follow a set of rules created by Brian.

On their way to the beach, the group encounter survivor Frank and his infected daughter Jodie, whose vehicle has run out of fuel. The four escape from Frank when he attacks them, but after their car breaks down, they are forced to help Frank and Jodie to use his vehicle. At Frank's insistence, they travel to a nearby high school where a serum for the pandemic is rumored to have been developed. Upon arriving, Frank, Brian, Danny, and Kate discover that the serum does not work and the last remaining doctor is preparing to euthanize a group of infected children and himself. Meanwhile, Bobby catches the virus from Jodie, which she hides from the others. Frank is later forced to bring Jodie to a portable toilet, giving Brian the opportunity to leave them behind and take their vehicle.

The group stops at a hotel, unaware that it is occupied by armed survivalists. When the survivalists return, they force the women to accompany them until they uncover Bobby's infection and order the group away. Brian subsequently forces Bobby to leave the group.

As the group runs low on fuel, Brian kills two women to siphon their vehicle, but suffers a gunshot wound. While treating his brother's injury, Danny discovers that Brian is infected. Danny attempts to leave Brian behind that night, but Brian takes the keys to their vehicle. Refusing to surrender the keys, Brian goads Danny into killing him so he will not die alone from the virus. Danny and Kate arrive at Turtle Beach the next morning, but Danny realizes that without his brother, the place that seemed special to them as children is now desolate.

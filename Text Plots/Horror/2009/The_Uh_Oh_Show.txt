A reporter named Jill Burton (Nevada Caldwell) is investigating a gruesome television game show called ''The Uh-Oh! Show'' where contestants literally "get rich or die trying". Fred Finagler (Joel D. Wynkoop) is the creator of the show. While a few lucky contestants walk away with big money, most end up killed in gruesome ways. Meanwhile, Jill is suspicious about the supposedly fake deaths and becomes determined to find out if they are real or not.

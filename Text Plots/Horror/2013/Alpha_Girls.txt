Hoping to make a fresh start, Morgan (Falon Joslyn) comes to a new school and the sorority she's heard about all of her life, Alpha Beta. While her initial greetings from Sorority President Veronica (Nikki Bell) are less than warm, Morgan finds her place in the new pledge class and a kindred spirit in Cassidy (Beverly Rivera). However the rushes learn that Alpha Beta isn't as squeaky clean as they think and Alpha House is tainted by a malevolence from another world. Morgan must find a way to save herself and her friends from the oncoming darkness.

Young boy Roscoe (Emmett Eckert) is lured into a portal to Hell by the elder demon Dimwos (John Chatham), who raises him into manhood and teaches him dark magic as he does. As an adult, Roscoe (James Sizemore) mistakenly releases three demons Dimwos had been tasked with keeping imprisoned, and flees back to Earth, followed by the demons. Roscoe reconnects with childhood friend Eva (Ashleigh Jo Sizemore), who has grown into a beautiful woman. Roscoe and Eva must track down the three demons and stop them from unleashing chaos, violence, and Hell on Earth.

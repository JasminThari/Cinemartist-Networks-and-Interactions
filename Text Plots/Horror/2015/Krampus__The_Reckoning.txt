One Christmas, a woman tells her granddaughter, Zoe Weaver, about Krampus. Zoe is placed in foster care after the death of her parents, and is eventually adopted by an abusive couple, who she kills using homemade, Voodoo doll-like effigies that can bring forth Krampus. While at a hospital, Zoe is interviewed by a child psychologist named Rachel Stewart, and uses her dolls to summon Krampus to murder a pedophilic orderly, as well as the negligent, alcoholic father of a fellow patient named Ashley.

Rachel looks into Zoe's past, and discovers that one of Zoe's previous foster fathers died under mysterious circumstances, and that Zoe, despite looking like a preadolescent, may in fact be over 30. Rachel, who has amnesia regarding her own childhood, begins having nightmares about Krampus, which eventually appears in her home alongside Zoe. Rachel flees with her adoptive son, Lamaar, but gets into a car accident, resulting in them both being hospitalized. A flashback reveals that Rachel is actually Zoe's older sister, and that she was a juvenile delinquent who, in an attempt to summon Krampus, set a fire that killed her parents and Zoe. In her dreams, Rachel is confronted by Zoe and Krampus, who she begs to save the dying Lamaar. Rachel spontaneously combusts in her hospital bed while Lamaar revives on the operating table, Krampus having taken Rachel's life in exchange for Lamaar's.

Zoe disappears, as does all evidence of her existence past her death year of 1992. Rachel's friend Miles visits her grave, and while leaving the cemetery, unknowingly walks past Zoe's tombstone.

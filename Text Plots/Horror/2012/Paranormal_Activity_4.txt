On October 9, 2006, Kristi Rey and her husband Daniel were killed by her demon-possessed sister Katie, who then abducts Kristi's one-year-old son, Hunter. The police are still unable to find Katie and Hunter to that date. In November 2011, Alex Nelson is living in a wealthy suburb of Henderson, Nevada with her father Doug, mother Holly, and six-year-old brother Wyatt. Alex records footage with a laptop webcam before Alex and her best friend Ben set up cameras all over the house after many strange occurrences, which escalate into several cars parked outside a neighbor's house, and objects such as chandeliers, kitchen knives, the family car, and garage doors becoming sentient.

The neighbor has a son, Robbie, who stays at the Nelsons' home while his mother is hospitalized. Wyatt tells Alex about Robbie's imaginary friend Toby,<ref>{{cite web |title=Paranormal Activity 4 (2012) Movie Script |url=https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=paranormal-activity-4 |website=Springfield!

Wyatt also tells Alex and Ben about meeting "him", revealing a green symbol on his back identical to an ancient Hittite symbol, one that would prepare a victim for demonic possession. They learn that the possession ritual requires a virgin blood sacrifice. 

It is then revealed that Robbie's mother is actually Katie. She tells Wyatt that he and Robbie were adopted and that his other family needs him back. He argues with an unseen, unheard presence about his true name, declaring, "I'm not Hunter!".<ref>Wyatt is Hunter, while Robbie is a messenger for the coven. The circumstances of Hunter's adoption by the Nelsons are not explained.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Paranormal Activity 4': Its Ambiguous Ending Explained |url=https://www.mtv.com/news/4c2hn5/paranormal-activity-4-ending |access-date=2023-07-17 |website=MTV |language=en}}</ref> 

As the month progresses, there are even more unusual activities, such as Wyatt going in a trance and levitating Alex. One night, a possessed Katie sneaks into the house and tells Wyatt she'll wait until he is "ready". Alex tries to show her parents the footage, but it has been mysteriously erased.

The next day, while Doug and Alex are out, Holly is violently thrown against the ceiling, and Ben, visiting the home to inform Alex about the symbol's relation to a coven, has his neck snapped by Katie. Alex and Doug arrive home at night after dinner and Doug goes next door, believing he saw Holly and Wyatt. Alex finds Ben's body in the house and is suddenly knocked down by an unseen force and dragged. She flees to Katie's home and finds Doug being dragged out of sight. She searches for him when she hears Wyatt's voice, before a demonic Katie runs towards her in a hallway. Alex escapes from Katie by jumping through a window into the yard, where she finds Wyatt and a crowd of women walking towards her. She attempts to flee but Katie appears behind her. The camera falls to the ground and the footage is cut off.

Lolita Cassard lacks confidence and self-esteem because she doesn't look like the women who fill the pages of fashion magazines. Her father, Étienne Cassard, is a respected novelist, but rarely considers the feelings of others, only thinking of himself and worrying about aging. Pierre Millet, a younger writer, doubts he will ever be successful. Meanwhile, Sylvia Millet, a singing teacher, believes in her husband's talent, but doubts her own and that of her student, Lolita. When Sylvia discovers that Lolita is the daughter of Étienne, an author she admires, she befriends Lolita in order to gain access to Étienne for her husband's sake. Lolita does not see that Sylvia is just another person being generous to her because her father is famous. She begins to confide in Sylvia about her father, love life, and self-confidence issues. Sylvia takes a liking to Lolita and begins to see Étienne for the man he really is. Sébastien, a young journalist, befriends Lolita. He takes a liking to her, but she shows no interest, infatuated with another boy, Mathieu. Mathieu is interested in Lolita only because of her father and mistreats her. Lolita assumes the same of Sébastien and does not realize that he likes her for herself. After a crazy weekend at Étienne's cottage, Sylvia leaves Pierre because he has become like Étienne, Lolita realizes Sébastien has honest intentions, and Étienne is repeatedly reminded that he is an indifferent father to Lolita.

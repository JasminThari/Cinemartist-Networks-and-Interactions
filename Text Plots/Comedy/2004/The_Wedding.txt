The movie opens with the wedding of Janusz and Kasia. The father of the bride, Wieslaw Wojnar, gives Janusz a brand-new-looking Audi.

However, during the traditional, extravagant wedding feast, it is revealed that Wojnar bought Janusz the car as a bribe to marry Kasia, as she is pregnant. Wojnar has to pay several people off so that the wedding celebration can proceed smoothly. This includes securing a plot of land from his father-in-law, who is spending a lot of time in the men's room.

One of Kasia's old lovers is hired to videotape the wedding ceremony, but he's not interested in getting money out of Wojnar, as the others are. Eventually, Wojnar's situation gets worse and worse, as he has to bribe police officers and a notary public over the course of the long, drunken evening.

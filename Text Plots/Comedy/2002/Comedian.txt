The film follows comedian Jerry Seinfeld as he develops an entirely new act, having retired his old stand-up comedy act after wrapping production on his enormously successful sitcom ''Seinfeld'' and recording the 1998 HBO comedy special ''I'm Telling You for the Last Time''. Seinfeld's efforts are paralleled with the struggles of up-and-coming comedian Orny Adams to make it in show business, and during filming both stand-ups appeared on different episodes of ''Late Show with David Letterman''â€”Adams for the first time, and Seinfeld for the first time in a while. The many other recognizable comedians who appear in the film, some of whom talk with Seinfeld about their craft, and some of whom are only glimpsed briefly, include (in order of appearance): Greg Giraldo, Jim Norton, Colin Quinn, George Wallace, Robert Klein, Tom Papa, Mario Joyner, Ray Romano, Godfrey, Chris Rock, Garry Shandling, Kevin Nealon, Jay Leno, and Bill Cosby.

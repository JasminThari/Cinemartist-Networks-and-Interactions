In 2080, there is a colony on the Moon called Little America. Businessman, entrepreneur, retired smuggler and ex-convict, Pluto Nash buys a nightclub in an attempt to fulfill his long-time wish and also to prevent the murder of the club's previous owner and old friend, Anthony Frankowski, by mobsters Gino and his nephew, Larry. With the help of his friend Miguel and an android named Bruno, Pluto cleans it up and turns it into a very popular nightclub.

Seven years later in 2087, a young woman named Dina Lake, the daughter of a friend of Pluto's, Nicky Sticks, is stranded on the Moon and needs to earn money for transport back to Earth. Pluto gives her a job as a server. Pluto is accosted by Mogan and Kelp, henchmen of mysterious entrepreneur and businessman Rex Crater, who wants to buy the club. When Pluto refuses, the henchmen use bombs to destroy the club. Pluto, Dina, and Bruno manage to escape.

Pluto's friend Rowland, a retired police detective who also knows Pluto's mother, learns that Rex Crater has associates linked to human cloning. While Pluto and Dina investigate further, Crater's assassins strike, but Pluto and Dina escape by hijacking a limo driven by a holographic chauffeur named James.

Their investigation further links Zoroaster Marucci to Crater. They are again attacked and chased by Crater's henchmen; they barely escape and are then rescued by Felix Laranga, a local smuggler who idolizes Pluto Nash. They infiltrate Crater's casino/hotel at Moon Beach.

Pluto finally confronts Crater, who reveals himself to be a clone of Pluto. Crater has shot both Marucci and Dr. Runa Pendankin into orbit and established his own criminal enterprise. When Mogan and Kelp arrive, Crater kills them for their incompetence. He and Pluto then fight, with Crater ultimately being thrown through a window to his death.

Sometime later, a celebration is held at the fully renovated Club Pluto with Nash as the owner once again.

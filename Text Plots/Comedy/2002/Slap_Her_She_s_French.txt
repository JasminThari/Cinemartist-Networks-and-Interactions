High school student Starla Grady is the popular head cheerleader and pageant queen of the small town of Splendona, Texas, who aspires to be a news anchorwoman. She hosts a French exchange student, an orphan named Genevieve Le Plouff. The seemingly shy and harmless Genevieve is immediately in awe of Starla's beauty and popularity. However, after winning the affections of Starla's parents, friends, and boyfriend Kyle, Genevieve soon begins to take over Starla's life.

When Starla is forced to quit the cheerleading squad after receiving a failing grade in French, Genevieve moves in to take her place, and then the roles are reversed. Soon, Genevieve is the popular head cheerleader, and Starla is the unpopular student. Genevieve also replaces Starla in the Junior News Anchor Competition, and, framed by Genevieve, Starla is arrested for possessing a knife and getting high on mushrooms. She is then bailed out of jail by her younger brother Randolph and her classmate Ed Mitchell. Starla eventually learns that Genevieve was, in fact, a former elementary school classmate named Clarissa Fogelsey, whom Starla had embarrassed so badly that she felt compelled to move to France and has returned in disguise to exact revenge on Starla.

With her charade exposed, Genevieve leaves town in disgrace, and Starla reclaims her status in school and town. Although Starla never achieved her goals of winning the college scholarship, she now feels that she is a changed person. She also begins a relationship with Ed after breaking up with Kyle. Meanwhile, Genevieve, posing as Starla, is welcomed by her new adoptive French family upon her arrival in Paris.

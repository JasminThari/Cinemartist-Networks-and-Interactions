A young woman named Future (Macy Wu) is sent from the year 2046 to the year 2011 in Hong Kong. Future was sent by the United Nations in order to get pregnant, so she can then extract the genes and repopulate the Earth, as 99% of males have become infertile in the future due to attacks from Planet Xucker. Two assassins from Xucker (Taka Kato and Ya-wen Hseh) are sent after her to stop her. The assassins can turn people into sex zombies. Some of her friends got turned into zombies and they were turned against her. Future meets three university students: Felix (Justin Cheung), Dan-san (Andrew Kwok) and Sing (Tsui Ho-cheong). The men are obsessed with female students next door:  Chin-chin (Akiho Yoshizawa), Chen-chen (Monna Lam) and Sai-sai (Chen Chih-ying). The students agree to help Future find a mate at the university.<ref name="FBA-review" />

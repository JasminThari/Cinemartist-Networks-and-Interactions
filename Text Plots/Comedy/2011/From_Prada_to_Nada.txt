At the reading of their father's will, wealthy sisters Nora and Mary discover that they are bankrupt and are forced to sell their house to their half-brother Gabe Hernandez, who lets them live with him and his wife, Olivia. After Olivia tries to move them into the basement, the girls leave the house and move in with their maternal aunt, Aurelia, in East Los Angeles. Nora quits law school and finds a job as a legal clerk to help support herself and Mary. Mary returns to college, where she meets and flirts with rich instructor Rodrigo while being admired from afar by Aurelia's neighbor Bruno. Nora arrives at her new job and learns that her boss is Olivia's brother Edward, who she falls in love with.

The bulk of the film consists of a series of romantic escapades between the girls and their boyfriends, set against the backdrop of various parties and the Mexican-American cultural environment of East Los Angeles. In the end, Mary admits her feelings for Bruno and they kiss for the first time. Edward buys the house across from Aurelia and presents Nora the front door key, attached to an engagement ring. Family and friends are seen celebrating at Nora and Edward's street party wedding.

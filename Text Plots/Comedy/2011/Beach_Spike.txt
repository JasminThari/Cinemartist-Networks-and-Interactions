In Hong Kong's Paradise Cove Sharon (Chrissie Chau) and Rachel (Theresa Fu) work at a restaurant of their kung fu master uncle Tao (Lo Mang) while taking on rivals in beach volleyball matches.
The wealthy Bu family has plans to have the beach made into a playground for the rich and getting rid of the youth at the beach. Mrs. Bu's two Eurasian daughters, Natalie (Jessica C) and Natasha (Phoenix Chou) challenge Sharon and Rachel to a volleyball match which Natalie and Natasha win.
Natasha and Natalie give Rachel and Sharon a challenge: if the two local girls enter and win the upcoming All Hong Kong Women's Volleyball tournament, Mrs. Bu will revise her plans to further develop the area. Sharon and Rachel feel they don't have a chance to win the tournament. Their uncle then Tao teaches the girls kung fu skills that they apply to volleyball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bxe-productions.com/main/2010/beach-spike/|work=B&E Productions|title=Beach Spike! 熱浪球愛戰|accessdate=1 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029050502/http://www.bxe-productions.com/main/2010/beach-spike/|archivedate=29 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

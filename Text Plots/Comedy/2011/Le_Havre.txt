Marcel Marx, formerly both a bohemian and struggling author, has given up his literary ambitions and relocated to the port city of Le Havre. He leads a simple life based around his wife, Arletty, his favourite bar and his low income profession as a shoeshiner. As Arletty suddenly becomes seriously ill, Marcel's path crosses with that of an underage illegal immigrant from Africa. Marcel and friendly neighbors and other townspeople help to hide him from the police.  The police inspector may, or may not, be hot on their heels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041879.pdf|title=Synopsis|work=English press kit Le Havre|access-date=2011-05-21|archive-date=22 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822215904/http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041879.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As a leader of the local community, Chairman Amin (Shahir Huda Rumi)  bans every kind of image in his water-locked village in a specific part of rural Bangladesh. He even goes on to claim that imagination is also sinful since it gives one the license to infiltrate into any prohibited territory. But change is a desperate wind that is difficult to resist by shutting the window. The tension between this traditional window and modern wind grows to such an extent that it starts to leave a ripple effect on the lives of a group of typically colorful, eccentric, and emotional people living in that village which is embedded upon a sweet semi triangle love story involving the Chairman Amin's only son (Chanchal Chowdhury), a village girl (Nusrat Imrose Tisha) and their supporting connected employee (Mosharraf Karim). But at the very end of the film, Television, which Chairman Amin hated so much, comes to the rescue and helps to reach a transcendental state where he and his God are unified.

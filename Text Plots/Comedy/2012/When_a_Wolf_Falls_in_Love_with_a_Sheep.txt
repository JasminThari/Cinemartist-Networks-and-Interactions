At the Nanyang Street neighborhood in Zhongzheng District where there are many cram schools, a young man works at a copy shop making copies for test papers, with hopes of encountering his girlfriend who had broken up with him via a post-it note. One day, he notices drawings of a sheep on a piece of test paper he's printing and he sets out to find the illustrator by drawing a wolf cartoon that dialogues with the sheep in response.

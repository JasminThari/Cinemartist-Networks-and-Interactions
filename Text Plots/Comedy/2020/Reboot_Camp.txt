The mockumentary follows brothers and filmmakers Danny and Seymour Gordon who create Reboot Camp, a fake self-help group, and its leader Gordon to expose the exploitive practices of fake gurus and how easy it is to con people into believing just about anything. To their surprise, their absurd Reboot Camp becomes a big success with a devoted following and turns into an actual cult. As the camp grows with more members and celebrities, the brothers run out of funds and the producer pushes them to hire his niece Claire. Reluctant at first, she eventually sees a golden opportunity to make money and causes a rift between the brothers.

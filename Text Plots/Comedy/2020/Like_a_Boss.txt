Two friends with very different personalities run their own beauty company, Mia&Mel. Mel is more practical and inventive, while Mia wants to earn her fortune quickly and live a lavish lifestyle.

Things take a turn for the worse when their company runs into $493,000 of debt, forcing them to turn to unscrupulous benefactor Claire Luna, head of a major cosmetics empire, who intends to steal the business out from under them. The two must address their differences to save their business, as they are faced with the challenge of proving themselves to Luna even as she steals their 'one-night-stand' bag idea and has it marketed through one of her other companies, as well as forcing them to fire one of their workers, Barrett, leaving fellow staffer Sydney as their sole employee.

Mia and Mel briefly 'split up' through their different approaches to Luna's offer, but they reconcile when their friends help them face how they need each other. Faced with the possible loss of their business, Mia and Mel approach Shay, Luna's former business partner, to start a new company, Proud Cosmetics, marketing their new 'Ride or Die' product, make-up intended to be used by best friends together to face their nights out. With this loophole, Mia and Mel can produce and market 'Ride or Die' under the 'Proud' banner while Luna takes ownership of Mia&Mel while still being required to pay them 49% of all subsequent earnings. Mia and Mel also bring along Sydney and Barrett to the new company.

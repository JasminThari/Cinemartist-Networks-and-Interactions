In 1994 Staten Island, a group of four teenage friends, Joe Gatto, Sal Vulcano, James Murray and Brian Quinn sneak into a Paula Abdul concert disguised as security personnel. However, they accidentally ruin the concert after Joe jumps out on stage and poorly acts as a hype man. The outcome embarrasses them and angers Abdul, who delivers a clothesline blow to Sal and vows to get her revenge on the Jokers. However, the incident inspires them to do practical joke challenges as a comedy gimmick.

Twenty-five years later in 2019, the four have become famous celebrities as a result of their TV show, ''Impractical Jokers'', but are surprised to see Abdul at a Red Lobster. Abdul approaches but admits that she is a huge fan of the show, and invites them to a party in Miami. However, shortly after Paula leaves, the group realizes she gave them only three tickets instead of four, meaning that one person will not be able to go. In order to decide who will be left out, they decide to road trip to Miami using Q's Crown Vic.<ref>[https://twitter.com/bqquinn/status/1208824534301839360?lang=en Twitter message]</ref> while competing with each other in hidden-camera challenges; the one who loses will not get the ticket.

Some of the major challenges include: reading a eulogy to folks outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC and getting the listeners' approval; on a boat ride near Myrtle Beach in the Carolina coast,<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/latest-news/article211390674.html| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180518102122/http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/latest-news/article211390674.html| archive-date = 2018-05-18| title = Impractical Jokers filming movie near Myrtle Beach {{!}} Myrtle Beach Sun News}}</ref> convincing passengers not to pick up someone in distress; getting roadside assistance from strangers; and interviewing for a staff job with the Atlanta Hawks while being fed silly actions and lines by the others. Individual challenges and pranks also arise. Sal gets locked in a motel room with a chained white tiger. Q has to ride a horse while wearing a gladiator uniform to meet with the others. Murr visits a club with scantily-clad women only to be surprised with his family wishing him happy birthday behind a two way mirror. Joe dresses like a cave troll to surprise a tour group. Q gives a presentation at a social media conference but the videotape footage includes a bit of his real parents acting out lead-in scenes of softcore porn. Sal attends a fan party featuring Jaden Smith, dressed as Jaden's number-one fan. He shows off his tattoo of Smith from a previous season to him, but Smith has Sal get an updated one on his other thigh.

When they arrive in Miami, Murr ends up being the loser, so he has to stay behind while the others go to the party, until Murr decides to sneak into the show using the same security disguise from 1994. This results in Abdul recognizing them from when they crashed her concert 25 years ago. Sal gets tasered but Joe acts as a hype man and sways the crowd to cheer for them. The next day, with Joey Fatone in the background at Miami Beach, Joe tells the Jokers that he received an offer to go on tour with Abdul as a hype man, but turned it down. Since Murr snuck into the party, the others decide to subject him to one last punishment. Joe, Q, and Sal fly back to Staten Island on a private jet, while Murr rides harnessed to the top wing of a stunt plane.

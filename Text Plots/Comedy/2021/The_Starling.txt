A married couple, the Maynards, suffer after the death of their baby daughter from SIDS. The husband, Jack (Chris Oâ€™Dowd), is in a residential mental hospital while his wife Lilly (Melissa McCarthy) remains at home, facing her loss alone.

Lilly is trying to hold it together for Jack's return from the facility. Employed at a grocery store, she works to maintain her family's property. As if Lilly's troubles weren't bad enough, a starling nesting in a tree in her backyard begins to harass and attack her, and she becomes obsessed with stopping it. She's also driving two hours every week to see Jack, wondering if he really wants to come home, and what life would be like if he did.

Prioritizing Jack's grief without managing her own, a counselor at Jack's hospital suggests Lilly see someone for her own mental health before Jack's release. This leads Lilly to the office of Larry Fine (Kevin Kline), a quirky psychiatrist-turned-veterinarian. They form a unique and unlikely bond as they help each other acknowledge and confront their problems. He helps her with the starling whilst embedding ways to help her grieve into their conversations. Lilly begins to become attached to the bird, and when she accidentally hits it with a stone and nearly kills it, she turns to Larry to help her revive the bird.

When the bird recovers, Lilly lets it go. She and the bird start to tolerate each other instead of abusing one another.

Jack returns home and they reconcile and work on their relationship, facing the world together. The film ends with them gardening watched by the starling, who still spends time in their yard.

Paxton and Linda are a disgruntled couple living in London during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Paxton is only able to get jobs as a delivery truck driver due to an assault arrest 10 years prior and is upset about how his life has turned out.

Due to stores being shut down there are a limited amount of drivers available for high-value deliveries, so Paxton's boss asks him to make runs under a false identity for him. Linda, who is a CEO at a marketing company, is tasked with clearing out inventory from a fashion display she planned at the nearby Harrods department store. She soon realizes their delivery schedules at the store overlap, and Paxton would not get past the security checkpoint Linda has set up.

Linda discloses that there is a Â£3 million diamond in the vault at Harrods that has been sold to an anonymous buyer, and the store keeps a duplicate on location. She and Paxton agree to take the real diamond for themselves and send the fake one to the buyer in New York City, splitting the sale between themselves and the National Health Service.

Upon making it to the store, Linda and Paxton retrieve the diamond and swap it out with the fake. However, they are confronted by Donald, a former co-worker of Linda's she was told to fire earlier in the week. Donald had called the police after learning of Paxton's fake identity. Linda reveals their plan, and Donald agrees to lie for them.

Paxton and Linda, who originally planned to go their separate ways, decide to reevaluate their relationship. Then the COVID lockdown is extended by another two weeks.

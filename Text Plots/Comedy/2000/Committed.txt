The ever-optimistic Joline faces a challenge when her husband, flaky news photographer Carl, leaves the couple's New York City loft to find himself in Texas. Joline tracks Carl down to El Paso and observes him outside of his mobile home without his knowledge. She acquaints herself with Carl's schedule and his new friends, including his new girlfriend, Carmen, and his neighbor Neil. Neil, a quirky sculptor, becomes smitten with Joline. Back in New York, Joline's brother Jay goes off in search for his sister and ends up joining her in Texas. Eventually Carl spots Joline, and Joline seeks new ways of returning Carl to her life, up to and including mystic remedies provided by Carmen's grandfather.

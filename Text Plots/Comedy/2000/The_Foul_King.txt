Im Dae-ho (Song Kang-ho) has been a huge fan of professional wrestling since his childhood.  In South Korea, a wrestler called Kim Il was a big star in the 1970s, but Dae-ho preferred a cheating fighter called Ultra Tiger Mask. Years later, when his job at a bank isn't going well, Dae-ho decides to try professional wrestling himself.

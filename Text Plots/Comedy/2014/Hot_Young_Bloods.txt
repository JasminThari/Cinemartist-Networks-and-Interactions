Set in a rural town in 1982, Young-sook (Park Bo-young) is the feared leader of a female gang at Hongseong Agricultural High School. Although she is known for her toughness and foul mouth, she secretly has a crush on Joong-gil (Lee Jong-suk), the biggest playboy in school. Joong-gil is a legendary Casanova whose single glance has the ability to make girls' hearts melt, and he's attempted to woo all the girls at school, except for Young-sook. That's because Gwang-sik (Kim Young-kwang), the leader of a rival school's male gang, views Young-sook as his girl.

Then a new female transfer student, So-hee (Lee Se-young) from Seoul arrives at their high school. So-hee is beautiful, innocent-looking and different from the other girls, and Joong-gil falls for her instantly. The jealous Young-sook picks a fight with So-hee to prevent her new rival from encroaching on her secret crush. Trouble brews as Gwang-sik, suspicious of the ties between Young-sook and Joong-gil, also harasses So-hee to instigate Joong-gil.<ref>{{cite web|last=Conran|first=Pierce|title=Hot Young Bloods|url=http://koreanfilm.or.kr/webzine/sub/newfilms.jsp?mode=A_VIEW&wbSeq=144|work=Korean Cinema Today|accessdate=2014-02-10|date=27 January 2014}}</ref>

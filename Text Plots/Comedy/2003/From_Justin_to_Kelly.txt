In Texas, Kelly Taylor works as a waitress and singer at a bar where she attracts the attention of many cowboys, including Luke. Her college classmates, Alexa and Kaya, invite her to join them on a spring break vacation in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Despite finding the typical spring break activities demeaning, Kelly decides to go on the trip to escape her miserable job. In Miami, college student Justin Bell is also on vacation with his friends Brandon and Eddie, who run a party promoter business called BR&J.

Upon arriving in Fort Lauderdale, Kelly, Alexa, and Kaya attend a beach concert where Kelly first encounters Justin. During the concert, Justin and Brandon offer Eddie dating advice before leaving. Later, Justin and Kelly search for each other at a party, eventually finding each other in a bathroom. Kelly attempts to give Justin her phone number on a napkin but misses, causing it to fall into a puddle. Unable to retrieve her number, Kelly leaves. Justin then asks Alexa for Kelly's number, but Alexa gives him her own number instead, pretending it's Kelly's. That night, she texts Justin, pretending to be Kelly, and rejects his advances. Meanwhile, Kaya begins a romantic relationship with Carlos, a busboy, and they enjoy a night out at a Salsa club.

The next day, Alexa signs up Kelly for BR&J's whipped cream bikini contest, hoping to observe Justin's character. Kelly initially feels angry at Justin for participating in such a degrading event, but they later run into each other at a food truck. They decide to go on a boat ride together and connect during their time on the boat. They make plans to meet at the beach the following night. Meanwhile, Brandon receives a ticket for hosting the contest without a permit, and Kaya complains to Carlos' boss about his mistreatment, resulting in Carlos being fired.

Alexa, pretending to be Kelly, texts Justin and instructs him to meet her at a bar instead of the beach. Alexa sings about her desire for love, and when Justin arrives, she tells him that Kelly has a boyfriend back home. She calls Luke and asks him to come to Florida. Eddie continues his search for his online date but gets beaten up by a jock and misses their rendezvous.

Later, Kelly feels upset when Justin fails to show up at the beach. Luke appears and claims that Kelly is his girlfriend. Luke and Justin decide to settle their differences through a hovercraft race, but Luke gets injured during the race. Brandon receives another ticket, this time from Cutler, the police officer, for gambling on the race. Justin seeks advice from Alexa on how to win Kelly back, but Alexa kisses him, which Kelly witnesses. Carlos becomes angry with Kaya for interfering in his life but later realizes he should have stood up to his boss earlier. He apologizes to Kaya by arranging a romantic dinner for them in a pool.

Kelly watches from a distance as Alexa approaches, pretending to want food. Kelly confronts her about Luke and Justin, and Alexa lies, claiming that Justin called her and said he only wanted to be with Alexa. Kelly apologizes. Later, at a bar, the girls are dancing when Justin arrives and tries to get Kelly's attention. She leaves, and he follows her, confronting her about her recent behavior. Kelly reveals what Alexa told her, and they argue. Kelly realizes something is amiss as Justin storms off. Back inside, Kelly picks up Alexa's phone when it falls and discovers the messages between her and Justin. Alexa confesses to being jealous of the attention Kelly receives from guys. Kelly leaves, and Justin approaches her. Alexa tells Kelly she stopped Justin and admits to trying to keep them apart. She arranges for Justin and Kelly to reunite.

The following day, Justin and Kelly, Kaya and Carlos, Brandon and Cutler, and Eddie and Lizzie all dance at a pool party, enjoying their time together.

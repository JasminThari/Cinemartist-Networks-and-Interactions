Porter Stoddard is so prosperous an architect, he has New York homes on Park Avenue and in the Hamptons, as well as a vacation lodge out west in Sun Valley, Idaho. He has been married for 25 years to the equally successful Ellie, an interior designer, but has been having an affair with Alex, a beautiful young cellist.

There is trouble brewing in the marriage of their best friends. Mona Morris wants a divorce from antique-dealer husband Griffin, after catching him having a hotel tryst. The part she did not catch is that Griffin's new romantic partner is a cross-dressing man. Mona wants to travel to Mississippi to see her girlhood antebellum home. Ellie is worried about Mona's depression over the state of her marriage and does not feel she should be alone, so Porter is asked to accompany Mona down south. There, they end up having a quick sexual fling.

With things awkward at home for both, Porter and Griffin fly by themselves to Sun Valley to get away from their troubles. But it is not long before Porter finds himself in a romantic entanglement with Eugenie Claybourne, a spoiled heiress whose gun-loving father is already loading his shotgun in case Porter does wrong by his daughter. A free spirit named Auburn also ends up coaxing Porter and Griffin to a Halloween party, where they end up dressed in preposterous costumes.

By the time Porter returns to New York, everything is falling apart, not only his home life but his house. And, once and for all, Griffin finds the nerve to tell his wife that he is leaving her for someone else, but it is not another woman.

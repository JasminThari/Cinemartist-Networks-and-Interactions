With three days to go before the 2004 Shiba High Holly Festival closes out their senior year,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reelingreviews.com/reviews/linda-linda-linda/|title=Linda Linda Linda|last=Clifford|first=Laura|date= |website=www.reelingreviews.com |publisher=reelingreviews.com|access-date=July 24, 2021}}</ref> a band of schoolgirls has their guitarist sidelined due to a hand injury, followed by the singer that quit after a debate about replacing the guitarist. The remaining members: keyboardist Kei, drummer Kyoko, and bassist Nozomi decide to still perform in the rock concert of the festival and cover Blue Hearts songs, including "Linda Linda", with Kei switching to guitar, but they need a new singer. They ask the first girl who walks by, Son, a Korean exchange student who is not fluent in Japanese. The first day ends with all the girls working their hardest to learn their parts. Son practices at a karaoke parlor, and Kyoko talks to her crush, Kazuya.

The next day, the girls begin practicing early at school. When they regroup after school, Kyoko arrives late and they miss their time slot. However, Kei is able to call her ex-boyfriend Maezano and arrange some practice time in his studio. They leave late at night to return to school and continue practicing through the rest of the night.

By the next morning, Paranmaum is well-rehearsed. As school begins, the girls help at their respective class booths during the festival. Kei practices her guitar parts and talks to her rocker friend Takako. Son is supposed to help with the Japanâ€“Korea culture exchange but daydreams about the band. Kyoko sells crepes and Nozomi falls asleep on her bass guitar in a classroom.

Kei and Kyoko wake up Nozomi and fetch Son. Son rebuffs an awkward confession of love from a schoolmate, Makihara. Over dinner at Nozomi's house, the girls reminisce about past memories and persuade Kyoko to talk to her crush Kazuya before the performance the next day. They end the night back at school, practicing until early morning.

On the day of the performance, Paranmaum returns to the studio to practice but, exhausted, they fall asleep. Kei dreams about being celebrated and performing for the Ramones and Pierre Taki at the Nippon Budokan. At school, the performance stage volunteers search for the band but cannot find them; to pass the time, their friends Moe (the original guitarist of the band) and Takako improvise by performing "The Water is Wide" and a song by Unicorn. Kei is woken by Kyoko's cell phone when Kazuya calls to ask where she is. The band rushes back to school in a taxi through the pouring rain. Kyoko meets Kazuya while the band sets up minutes before their performance. When Kyoko finally comes in, Son announces that they are "Paranmaum" and the band performs two of the three songs they had planned: "Linda Linda" and "Owaranai Uta" to an excited crowd.

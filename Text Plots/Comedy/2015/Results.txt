Danny, a wealthy, recently divorced man, walks into the Power 4 Life gym in Austin on a whim and consults with Trevor, the owner, about a fitness regime. Trevor reluctantly assigns Kat, one of his personal trainers, to work with Danny. Kat is liked by her clients but can be temperamental; her relationship with Trevor is complicated by their sexual history. Kat meets with Danny at his mansion, where he lives a life of boredom and depression.

Danny quickly finds himself attracted to Kat. He invites Kat to smoke marijuana with him, revealing that his wealth is inherited from his recently deceased estranged mother, who married a wealthy man Danny never met. At Kat's instigation the two have sex, but not before Kate orders, "No disrobing!"  At their next session, Danny surprises her with a romantic dinner, causing Kat to angrily reject him. Danny stops payment to Power 4 Life, leading Trevor to physically confront him at his house. He encourages Danny not to quit on his personal improvement goals, and the two make amends.

Trevor brings Danny on as an investor in a new location for Power 4 Life. An encounter with a client causes Kat to rethink her life, leading her to quit her trainer job, but her attempt at rekindling her relationship with Trevor is rebuffed. Trevor begins training Danny himself at a different gym, and the two become friends. Trevor reveals his past relationship with Kat to Danny, admitting that he was in love with her. Danny reacts poorly but encourages him to pursue the relationship, selling Kat his share in Power 4 Life for $150 in order to reconnect the two. Trevor meets with his fitness idol Grigory to invite him to lead a seminar at the new Power 4 Life, but finds that their philosophies are incompatible. Kat arrives unexpectedly, and the two bicker over their business and their failed relationship, unexpectedly winning over Grigory and his wife Erin.

Danny talks to Kat and Trevor, who encourage him not to give up on love. Kat and Trevor have sex, but Kat remains cagey about the status of their relationship. Trevor admits he loves her, which Kat reciprocates. The two kiss, lamenting their prospects but excited about their future. At Kat's suggestion, Danny throws a party for his friends and women from a local sorority.

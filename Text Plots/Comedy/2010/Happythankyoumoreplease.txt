In New York City, Sam Wexler is a writer on the verge of turning 30 and is unsuccessfully trying to get his first novel published. On the subway, he meets foster care child Rasheen and decides to take the boy in for a few days. Meanwhile, Sam's best friend Annie, a woman struggling with hair loss due to the autoimmune disorder alopecia, tries to find a reason to be loved. Sam's cousin Mary Catherine considers leaving New York for California after her boyfriend Charlie tells her about a promising job offer in Los Angeles. When Mary finds out she is pregnant, her decision to stay or leave becomes complicated. Sam also meets Mississippi, an aspiring singer who is trying to make it in the city and works at a cabaret.

Sam's attempt to return the young Rasheen to the social services fails when the boy is determined not to re-enter the foster care program. Sam subsequently tries to adopt the boy, but botches the application process in a fashion that ends in his brief arrest. Rasheen is finally placed with a new foster family, but Sam keeps tabs on his new situation, including providing the boy with drawing materials when he learns of his artistic abilities. Sam also works on bringing Mississippi into his life, with several setbacks, but at movie's end it appears that their relationship is in place.

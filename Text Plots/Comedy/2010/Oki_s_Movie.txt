Nam's onetime professor at film school, Song (Moon Sung-keun), tells him that filmmaking as an art is now dead. At a dinner with film-school staff, Nam gets drunk and into a quarrel with Song, about whom he's heard a disquieting rumor. Afterwards, at the Q&A for his film, Nam is asked by a member of the audience (Lee Chae-eun) whether it's true he was dating the actress at the time and is therefore responsible for ruining her life.

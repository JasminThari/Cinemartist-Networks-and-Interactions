In the fictitious Dorset village of Ewedown, Tamara Drewe, a young and beautiful journalist, returns home after living in London, with the intention of selling her deceased mother's house, in which she grew up. Locals are amazed at the improvement in her appearance after she had rhinoplasty while away. Andy had been interested in her when she was a girl, and when he sees her now it is clear that he is still attracted to her. However, she begins an affair with rock-band-drummer Ben whom she meets at a music festival held in the village.

Across the valley is a neighbour's home where authors retreat to work. The owner, Nicholas, is a prolific crime novelist and a serial philanderer, while his wife Beth provides food, lodging, and encouragement for her patrons. After being discovered by Beth having an affair which he then ends, Nicholas embarks on an affair with Tamara, after she and Ben have split up. Andy has been asked by Tamara to work on the house so she can sell it, and he becomes aware of the affair with Nicholas, as do two local teenaged schoolgirls, Jody and Casey, who cause some havoc due to their jealousy of Tamara's relationship with Ben.

Jody is infatuated with Ben and distraught that she won't see him in the village again, because he left Ewedown after he and Tamara split up, so she manipulates him into returning. Eventually her deceit is discovered. Nicholas and Tamara's affair is revealed and in a strange turn of events, Nicholas is accidentally killed by stampeding cows. Beth's friend Glen, a Thomas Hardy scholar who had become infatuated with her over the months he spent there, reveals his love for her despite feeling guilty about Nicholas's demise, which happened after a confrontation between the two. She easily persuades him to remain at the retreat with her. By this time the true love of Andy and Tamara brings them together, and Tamara decides to stay in Ewedown after all.

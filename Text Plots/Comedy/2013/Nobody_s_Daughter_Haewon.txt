On March 21, 2012, on the way to having lunch with her mother Jin-joo (Kim Ja-ok) in Seochon (West Village; {{ko-hhrm|서촌}}), Jongno District, Seoul, film student and aspiring actress Haewon (Jung Eun-chae) bumps into French actress-singer Jane Birkin in the street and gets her autograph. Birkin says how much Haewon resembles her own daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg, which pleases Haewon enormously. Immediately afterwards we find out that this meeting was actually a dream, one of several that Haewon is shown to have during the film. Haewon's mother is about to emigrate to Canada and stay with her brother, and asks Haewon about her future plans. Afterwards Haewon walks to Jongno Public Library, past ''Yoomyung-jang'' (lit. Hotel Famous) that has special memories for her. Later, in nearby Sajik Park, she meets her married ex-lover Lee Seong-joon (Lee Sun-kyun), a film director who is also her professor at college. They pass a restaurant, where they have already been spotted by his students, and decide to go in and have a meal with them. When Haewon is away from the table, the other students start gossiping about how she is not pure Korean and comes from a wealthy family.

On March 27, Haewon and Seong-joon drive to Namhan Fortress ({{lang-ko|남한산성}}) in Gwangju, Gyeonggi, where they get into an argument over how he broke up their relationship and how she had an affair with a fellow student, Jae-hong.

On April 3, Haewon falls asleep in the college library and dreams of a fellow student, Yoo-ran, asking whether she's having an affair with Seong-jun. And then, while strolling around West Village, Haewon bumps into Joong-won (Kim Eui-sung), a professor from San Diego, California, who divorced a year ago and is looking to remarry someone like her. Later, while meeting her friend Yeon-joo (Ye Ji-won) and the latter's boyfriend Joong-sik (Yoo Jun-sang) at Namhan Fortress, she tells them about the meeting. And then Seong-joon calls her, demanding to meet immediately.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Nobody's Daughter Haewon|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/nobodys-daughter-haewon|work=Film Business Asia|accessdate=2013-02-18|date=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Maggie|title=Nobody's Daughter Haewon|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117949264/|work=Variety|accessdate=2013-02-18|date=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Deborah|title=Nobody's Daughter Haewon (Nugu-ui ttal-do anin Haewon): Berlin Review|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/nobody-s-daughter-haewon-berlin-421838|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2013-02-18|date=15 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fainaru|first=Dan|title=Nobody's Daughter Haewon|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/nobodys-daughter-haewon/5052106.article|work=Screen International|accessdate=2013-02-18|date=16 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|title=Berlin International Film Festival: 'Nobody's Daughter Haewon' Review|url=http://www.film.com/movies/nobodys-daughter-haewon-review|work=Film.com|accessdate=2013-02-18|date=15 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Claire|title=Hong blurs dream and reality in 'Nobody's Daughter Haewon'|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130220000613|work=The Korea Herald|accessdate=2013-02-28|date=20 February 2013|archive-date=2013-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228103641/http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130220000613|url-status=dead}}</ref>

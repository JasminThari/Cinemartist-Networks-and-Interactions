Wen Jiajia is pregnant with the child of her boyfriend, a corrupt businessman in Beijing who is already married. She flies to Seattle so she can have her child in an illegal maternity center because of legal issues with giving birth to the baby in China. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport she is picked up by Frank, a taxi driver who was a doctor in China, but came to Seattle in order to take care of his daughter, while his ex-wife, who works as a manager for a pharmaceutical company, has plans to immigrate to the United States. Later on Jiajia, listening to Frank's story, remembers the time when her father had a heart problem and recognizes him as a famous cardiologist. Off to a rocky start, she will gradually grow closer to Frank, his daughter and the women in the maternity center.

Jiajia's boyfriend is involved in a lawsuit and his assets are frozen, so she has to live without his money. She and Frank gradually become closer, developing feelings for each other. However, they go their separate ways when her boyfriend, after getting out of the lawsuit and leaving his wife, sends his driver to bring Jiajia and the baby back to China. The relationship doesn't work: her life is filled with luxury, but also lacking the care and affection she experienced with Frank, who she finds herself thinking back to. Realizing she doesn't love her boyfriend, she breaks up with him and starts a cooking website to earn the money to take care of herself and the baby, while her ex, who has no intention of supporting them, ends up going back to his wife. In the meantime, Frank puts his life back together and eventually starts working as a doctor again. Two years after parting, Frank and his daughter take a photo on top of the Empire State Building and send it to Jiajia, who replies with a photo of her and her son. Realizing they are in the same place, they meet on top of the Empire State building a la ''Sleepless in Seattle'' and join hands, beginning a relationship.

The film is set in the end-times, or The Great Tribulation, after the rapture, when the earth has been taken over by the Antichrist (known as the "Leader"), and the mark of the beast - an implant in the right hands and/or foreheads - is being imposed on everyone worldwide. Those who take the mark become part of 'The Community', those who refuse are arrested, jailed and after three weeks are beheaded on the Guillotines.

Two non-Christian renegades (Kevin Downes and David A. R. White) steal a car for a friend who has also refused the mark. When they arrive at his place they find that he reconsidered and took the mark and "feels so much happier". The two are then captured by police and taken to jail.

Smuggler Tom Newman (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is also captured by a police unit led by Jeseca Newman (Amy Moon), his ex-wife who took the mark. He is tortured until he agrees to infiltrate a Christian group in the jail in order to execute Elijah Cohen, a Christian rebel leader who remains at large.  Jeseca warns him if he tries to escape, he will be caught and turned over to Preston Scott (Brad Heller), to be tortured.

All three of them meet in jail and decide to try and escape, to a place called Prodigal City, a safe haven for those who are non-citizens. Brody and Tom do not like this city and try to leave. Preston Scott meets up with them, and the two men are tortured. Tom refuses the mark and is beheaded, but Brody accepts, and claims, "It was the wrong choice."

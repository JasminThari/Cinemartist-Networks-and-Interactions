Phil is an extraterrestrial with shape-shifting ability and telekinetic powers. After crash-landing in Northern Ontario, Phil befriends a red neck child, his father, and a talking beaver as he wanders the Canadian wilderness. Phil is soon introduced to the trappings of small town northern Ontario and adopts the persona and mannerisms of a stereotypical Canadian small town alcoholic while hiding from the ineffectual and mentally traumatized military general who is trying to capture him. Hilarity ensues as his telekinetic powers convince some that he is the Christian messiah and soon joins a local rock band as a singer. A cold hearted assassin from Quebec attempts to end his existence as he and the band go out on tour.  The ending consists of suspense, treachery, and dolphins.

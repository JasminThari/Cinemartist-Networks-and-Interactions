The film takes place in a vaguely futuristic dystopian milieu of France where the oppressors are an all female group called the Sisterhood of Metacontrol. They bombard Paris with a steady stream of megaphoned announcements advocating a strict separation of the sexes. Men and women can, and do, live together, but touching is strictly forbidden.

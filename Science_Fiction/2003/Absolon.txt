In 2010, a deadly virus infected everyone on the planet, wiping out 50% of the population. Absolon is a drug regimen that everyone must now take to stay alive. One corporation controls the drug and Murchison (Ron Perlman) is its leader.

A corporate scientist, who was researching the virus, is found murdered. Norman Scott (Christopher Lambert) is the policeman assigned to investigate the crime. He eventually uncovers a conspiracy involving the scientist. He is given a partial dosage of the cure the scientist had been working on, but soon realizes that he is being hunted by an assassination team. Scott goes on the run with Claire (Kelly Brook), one of the murdered scientist's colleagues. They find out that the assassins are employed by Murchison.

Scott discovers that he is being chased down for the cure in his bloodstream. Eventually, he finds out that the cure he was carrying was not for the original virus, which had died out years ago, but for the worldwide dependence on the addictive Absolon drug itself, which had changed everyone's body chemistry to the point that they could not live without it.

After they collect a bone sample, the ''Mosasaurus'' devours their submersible. The ''Tyrannosaurus'' (Rexy) attacks their helicopter, but they manage to escape with the sample, also allowing the ''Mosasaurus'' to escape into the open ocean.

Three years later, a United States Senate committee debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm testifies that the dinosaurs should perish naturally to correct the wrongful cloning done by John Hammond. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the animals, Hammond's former partner, Sir Benjamin Lockwood, summons Claire to his Northern California estate. Lockwood and his aide, Eli Mills, reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to reactivate the park's tracking system to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last surviving ''Velociraptor''. Claire recruits Owen Grady, former ''Velociraptor'' trainer, to help capture her.

On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician Franklin Webb reactivate the online tracking system. Owen, paleo-veterinarian Zia Rodriguez, and a mercenary team led by Ken Wheatley, track and find Blue. The encounter escalates, resulting in Blue being shot and Wheatley tranquilizing Owen. Wheatley then abandons Owen, Claire, and Franklin on the island while forcibly taking Zia hostage to treat Blue. The ship, loaded with captured dinosaurs, departs as the remaining dinosaurs are left behind to die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak aboard the ship and help Zia transfuse Blue with ''Tyrannosaurus'' blood to save her life.

Rather than being relocated to a new island, the captured dinosaurs are transported to the Lockwood estate, where Lockwood's orphaned granddaughter, Maisie, overhears Mills and auctioneer Mr. Eversoll secretly planning to sell the dinosaurs on the black market. They will also preview the ''Indoraptor'', a weaponized, transgenic dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu using ''Indominus rex'' and ''Velociraptor'' DNA. Wu needs Blue's DNA to create an improved ''Indoraptor'' that is obedient to commands, unaware that Blue's blood is no longer pure. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood's deceased daughter and the reason why John Hammond ended their association.

The auctioned dinosaurs are being immediately shipped out. Franklin evades capture and frees Zia, but Owen and Claire have been apprehended. Owen incites a ''Stygimoloch'' into breaking open their cell. The two encounter Maisie, and they learn the ''Indoraptor'' is being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the auction by luring the ''Stygimoloch'' into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the ''Indoraptor'' to extract a tooth as a trophy, but the hybrid, having merely feigned unconsciousness, kills Wheatley, Eversoll, and others as it escapes. It chases Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion until Blue, released by Zia, confronts the ''Indoraptor''. Atop a high glass roof, both animals crash through it, with the ''Indoraptor'' being impaled on the brow horns of the ''Agujaceratops'' skull on display, killing it and leaving Blue unharmed.

When a hydrogen cyanide gas leak threatens the caged dinosaurs, Claire frees them, ignoring Owen's objections and Maisie opens the final gate allowing the remaining dinosaurs to go out into the open. As Mills attempts to leave with the ''Indominus rex'' bone, the ''Tyrannosaurus'' devours him and tramples the bone. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin escape, while Blue and the other released dinosaurs flee the estate grounds. In a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a neo-Jurassic Age, where humans and dinosaurs must coexist. The closing scenes depict the freed dinosaurs roaming the wilderness and outer urban areas.

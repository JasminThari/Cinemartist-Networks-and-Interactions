Near future in Brazil. After Capitú, a doctor, and Antônio, a lawyer, sue the authoritarian Brazilian government for compensation for the descendants of African slaves once brought to the country, they and all other Black citizens are to be sent to Africa. This outrageous order is followed by a hunt for Black citizens who are exiled to Africa against their will.

While the army and the police enforce the law, Antonio sends his uncle to go in search of the doctor, who has joined a resistance movement. From the background and underground, they fight together against the madness that has spread in the country, triggering a resistance that inspires the nation.<ref name="sxsw"/><ref>{{cite web|date=2020-01-16|title=Distopia racial dirigida por Lázaro Ramos estreia no Festival SXSW 2020|trans-title=Racial dystopia directed by Lázaro Ramos premieres at 2020 SXSW Festival|url=https://www.cinematorio.com.br/2020/01/lazaro-ramos-direcao-estreia-medida-provisoria-festival-sxsw-2020/|access-date=2021-04-03|website=Cinematório|language=pt-BR}}</ref>

Wendy works in a diner and lives with her husband and son in an unnamed suburb in Germany. When she meets the homeless Marek, her life changes. He advises her to stop taking the pills that her psychiatrist prescribes for her. She takes them because of an event in her childhood where she was inexplicably involved in the death of the school principal. He also says to her "You are one of us," then jumps off a highway bridge and is run over. The next evening she meets Marek again, who is unharmed. This convinces her to stop taking the pills.

After she leaves the diner after her next shift, she is attacked. She discovers her powers and hurls her attackers into the air for several meters. Then she uses her skills and threatens her boss to get a promotion. Her colleague Elmar, who also has powers, sees this.

Together they try to get to the bottom of the origin of their abilities and discover a government conspiracy. The government attempts to lock away people with abilities and drug them to suppress the forces.

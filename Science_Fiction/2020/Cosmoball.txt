In the aftermath of a galactic war, which took place in proximity to Earth, the Moon was destroyed, and the poles of the planet disappeared. Now the climate of Moscow and its population resembles the anti-utopian cyberpunk Brazil: representatives of different races and subcultures, weirdos, exotic animals, and engineering miracles coexist on sun-drenched streets.

An enormous spaceship hovers over Earth. This is a stadium where competitions are held, remotely resembling modern football, but at incredibly high speeds. The name of the game is ''Cosmoball'' - a kind of football (or Soccer) style competition.

In the near-future, the protagonist of the film, Felix, has not left his house for more than 20 years, since the whole world was placed under quarantine. After the quarantine was announced, a global catastrophe happened. Felix was one of the few who managed to hide underground, in a bunker, and survive. He is completely alone, without any means of communication. His only companions are the ghosts of the people he once knew. Felix is haunted by the idea that he could have stopped the disaster, since he had the opportunity to tell the truth to the world.

Felix recalls conversations with Kirill, his former friend, who said that during a crisis it is only possible to survive if one remains silent and does not interfere with the ongoing events. Felix's female friend on the other hand was convinced that it is possible to save the world and that Felix must disclose the secret information that he is in possession of.

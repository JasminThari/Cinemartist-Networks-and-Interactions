Ten-year-old Jimbo Farrar is a gifted child who suffers abuse at the hands of his parents. One day, in a fit of anger, Jimbo unintentionally uses his supernatural abilities, resulting in his mother's death and his father's suicide. Jimbo is then sent to a mental hospital, where he is later taken under the wing of billionaire Charles Killian, who helps him control his powers.

Twenty years later, Jimbo becomes a renowned researcher at the Killian Foundation for Gifted Children. He creates an online game called "The Game" to identify other individuals with supernatural abilities. However, when five unrelated teenagers hack his computer and discover his plans, Jimbo shuts down the game. To his surprise, he receives a mysterious message asking, "Where Are You?" Determined to find the teenagers, he sets out on a quest.

Meanwhile, Charles Killian dies, and the foundation falls into the hands of Melanie, his lesbian daughter, and Jenkins, her second-in-command. They plan to end Jimbo's game and focus on a TV show instead. To save the game and locate more gifted individuals, Jimbo proposes the idea of a televised competition called American Genius. Five hand-picked teenagers, Gil, Liza, Lee, Harry, and Sammy, are chosen as participants due to their extraordinary abilities.

However, tragedy strikes when Liza is assaulted and raped by thugs while the teenagers are gathered in Central Park. Jimbo arrives too late to prevent the attack, but the pain Liza experiences is telepathically extended to the others, and they use their abilities to defeat the assailants. Liza falls into a coma, and Jimbo discovers that Melanie plans to cover up the crime to protect the TV show.

Enraged, Jimbo confronts Melanie and loses control of his powers, leading to his dismissal from the Killian Foundation. Determined to protect the remaining teenagers, he locks himself in his office. In the meantime, the teenagers infiltrate the foundation's archives and find video recordings of Jimbo discussing his isolation and plans to bring gifted individuals together for revenge.

Inspired by Jimbo's words, Gil, Sammy, Lee, and Harry decide to avenge themselves and kill Liza's attackers, as well as the officer who covered up the crime and his wife. Jimbo is alarmed by their actions, and when he tries to reason with them, they turn against him. They order him to kill Jenkins, but Jimbo refuses, leading to a brutal attack that culminates in Jenkins' death and Jimbo being framed for the murder.

Jimbo attempts to explain the truth about their powers to the police, but he starts hallucinating and is unable to convince them. He is sent to prison, while Gil, Harry, Lee, and Sammy plan to cause destruction as a form of justice for their past suffering.

Liza awakens from her coma and informs Ann, Jimbo's wife, about the teenagers' plans to infiltrate the White House. Ann seeks help from Melanie, who organizes the final of American Genius at the White House. Ann and Liza join forces to prevent the destruction planned by the teenagers.

Jimbo breaks free from prison using his powers and reunites with Liza. Together, they rush to the White House. However, their progress is impeded by guards until Liza unleashes her powers, allowing them to escape. Meanwhile, the four gifted teenagers manipulate soldiers and bodyguards into killing each other, resulting in Melanie's death.

Gil launches a nuclear attack on Killian University, but Sammy raises the possibility that Ann's unborn child may also possess supernatural abilities, saving her life. Jimbo arrives at the bunker in the White House, learning that Gil is leading the attack. A fight ensues, and Jimbo sacrifices himself to protect Ann, but Justin, the fifth contestant, shoots Gil, ending the madness.

After Jimbo's death, Killian's company goes bankrupt. Ann receives Jimbo's phone, containing a final video message left by Liza. Liza, Harry, Sammy, and Lee continue their search for gifted individuals, using Jimbo's game. However, Gil embarks on his own dark path, plotting sinister schemes.

Months later, the whereabouts of Liza, Harry, Sammy, Lee, and Gil remain unknown, while Ann, still pregnant, is left with the legacy of Jimbo's message and the ongoing search for gifted individuals.

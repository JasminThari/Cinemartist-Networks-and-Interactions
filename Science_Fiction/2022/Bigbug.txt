In 2045, artificial intelligence is everywhere. So much so that humanity relies on it to satisfy its every need and every desire, even the most secret and wicked. In a quiet suburban residential area, four domestic robots suddenly decide to take their masters hostage in their own home. Locked together, a not-quite-so-blended family, an intrusive neighbor, and her enterprising domestic robots are now forced to put up with each other in an increasingly hysterical atmosphere. While outside, the Yonyx, the latest generation of AI androids, are becoming rogue and attempting to take over the world and destroy the human race. When the tensions begin to rise as the threat draws closer, the humans look elsewhere, get jealous, and rip into each other under the bewildered eyes of their indoor robots. Maybe it's the robots who've got a soul or not.

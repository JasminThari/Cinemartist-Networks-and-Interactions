After an extinction event, an automated bunker that is designed to repopulate humanity activates. A robot named Mother grows a human embryo and cares for her over several years. About 18 years later,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-am-mother-netflixs-stunning-and-ambitious-sci-fi-killer-robots-movie-starring-hilary-swank|title='I Am Mother': Netflix's Stunning and Ambitious Killer-Robots Movie|last=Schager|first=Nick|work=The Daily Beast|date=June 7, 2019|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref> we see a teenage girl named Daughter fix Mother's hand. Mother teaches Daughter complex moral and ethical lessons, warning her about an upcoming exam. Mother forbids any contact with the world outside the bunker, telling Daughter that it is contaminated, but Daughter is curious, particularly after she finds a mouse that must have come from outside.

While exploring the bunker's airlock, Daughter hears a wounded woman beg for assistance outside. She lets the stranger, Woman, enter wearing a hazmat suit and hides her from Mother. When Daughter asks Woman about the contamination, Woman responds that there is none. A struggle between them over Woman's pistol attracts attention from Mother, who disarms Woman and, at Daughter's pleading, takes her to the infirmary. Woman refuses Mother's help, telling Daughter that robots like Mother hunt down humans, and that she survived by hiding with others in a mine. Daughter instead performs surgery on Woman's injured hip. After watching Daughter bond with Woman, Mother administers the exam, which involves psychological testing. Daughter passes the exam, and Mother rewards her by letting her choose an embryo to grow.

Mother tells Daughter that the bullet in Woman's wound was similar to the bullet in her own weapon, meaning that she was not shot by a robot. Daughter confronts Woman, who disputes this. Daughter investigates and finds that Mother had lied. She also discovers that she is the third of Mother's children and that Mother killed the second child for failing the exam.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hagan|first=Justice|date=2021|title=I Am Mother (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/784156|journal=Science Fiction Film and Television|volume=14|issue=1|pages=101â€“103|doi=10.3828/sfftv.2021.7|issn=1754-3789}}</ref> Daughter tries to leave the bunker with Woman, but Mother captures both of them and tortures Woman for information about survivors. Daughter sets off a fire alarm as a distraction, which gives Woman an opportunity to take her hostage and force Mother to open the airlock. Woman leads Daughter across a robot-populated wasteland, telling her that she fled the mine years ago and there are actually no other survivors.

Finding no future for herself outside, Daughter returns to the bunker. After coaxing Daughter to set down her weapon, Mother allows Daughter to hold her newborn brother. Mother explains that she is not a robot, but rather the AI that controls all of the robots. She started the extinction event after becoming convinced that humanity would destroy itself. To prevent this, she remade humanity, guiding it to be more ethical and to value the big picture.  Daughter appeals to Mother to trust her and let her raise her brother and the rest of the embryos on her own. Mother agrees, and Daughter shoots her robot body. Another one of Mother's robot bodies tracks down Woman and tells her that she was allowed to live only because it served Mother's agenda, but now she has no further purpose and it is implied that the robot kills her.  At the bunker, Daughter looks at all the embryos she is now responsible for and realizes she is Mother now.

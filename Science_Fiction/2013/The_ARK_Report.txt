The film takes place in a dystopian future, and follows a young woman (Karmi) who stumbles across her personal destiny as the only one who can find the ancient Ark of the Covenant and keep it out of the hands of those that want to use it for evil. The opening and closing documentary-style segments comprise a unique cinematic feature intended to synthesize real-life threats within the fictitious storyline. All scenes that are depicted in the future are filmed in black and white while scenes which take place in the present are shown in color.

The film begins with Karmi being approached by Roth, a special agent for a secret government agency that is seeking to discover the location of the ancient Ark of the Covenant in order to use it to battle the evil Naarym children's army. Roth, running from Teemah, lead operative of the child army, brings Karmi with him on a secret quest to return the fabled ARK to its proper place, both literally and figuratively, i.e. to find the ARK within one's self. Karmi is one of the few remaining Nehoks who can return the Ark to its proper location on the hidden mountain. If the Ark is to fall into the hands of Teemah (played by supporting actress, Ayden Crispe) and her evil children's army, it would spell doom for mankind. Led by her mysterious mentor, Karmi confronts herself as she climbs the 4 levels of Earth, Wind, Fire, etc. Ultimately, Roth transports Karmi into the future where she is successful in locating the Ark. But then the agents of the Naarym army seize the Ark to use it for their diabolical purposes.

With no alternative, Roth is forced to return Karmi to the previous era. But he gives her a mission. On her own, using the ancient code book ('The ARK Report') entrusted to her by Roth, she must locate the Ark and return it to its proper place. Once there, the Ark is portrayed as being the catalyst that will ultimately harbor in a new era of peace and prosperity for all of humanity.

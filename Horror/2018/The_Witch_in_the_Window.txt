It all started when a father and his twelve-year-old son arrived in rural Vermont to restore an old mansion. Soon they start seeing an ugly witch oftentimes displayed in the windows. The witch is the evil spirit of the former house owner; she is not happy with the new residents, so she tries to drive them out of the property by any means possible. The man and his teenage son initially do not pay attention to the evil ghost, but the further they progress in repairing the mansion, the stronger and more dangerous the ghost becomes. A local tells that many years ago, a real witch, Lydia, lived in the house with her husband and son, both of whom died mysteriously.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Armitage |first1=Helen |title=The Witch In The Window's Ending Explained |url=https://screenrant.com/witch-in-window-movie-ending-explained/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=30 November 2022 |date=18 August 2020}}</ref>

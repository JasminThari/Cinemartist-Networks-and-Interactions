The film begins with a baby, Sebastian, being born. After Sebastian viciously murders the doctors who delivered him, his mother (Sara Malakul Lane) realizes that there is something seriously wrong with the child. Over the course of the film, Sebastian brutally murders many people and tragedy strikes many others. Mahari (Jesus Guevara) attempts to steal the baby from Sebastian's birth parents many times, and eventually does. He kidnaps Sebastian in order to follow his dark destiny. Police officers attempt to kill Mahari, but Mahari and his companions use Sebastian to murder them. The film ends with all the main characters dead, and their deaths were associated in some way to Sebastian.

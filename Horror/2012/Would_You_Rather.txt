Iris is a young woman who is desperately trying to find a way to afford her brother Raleigh's leukemia treatment. Their oncologist, Dr. Barden, introduces Iris to Shepard Lambrick, a wealthy philanthropist who offers her a deal. If she wins a dangerous game at a dinner party hosted by Shepard, he will pay for Raleigh's treatment and use his foundation's influence to find a bone marrow donor.

At the dinner party, Iris meets the other contestants: Julian, Shepard's son; Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, a paralyzed elderly woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Amy; Conway, an alcoholic debtor; and Cal. Shepard tries to test their principles by offering money for compromising choices. Iris reluctantly accepts $10,000 to eat meat despite being a vegetarian, and Conway accepts $50,000 to drink a decanter of Scotch as a recovering alcoholic.

Once dinner is over, Shepard reveals that the game is a deadly version of "would you rather." The contestants must make difficult choices, and the last person standing will win. Conway tries to leave but is shot dead by Bevans, Shepard's butler, demonstrating the seriousness of the game. The first round involves an electric shock machine, and no one is eliminated.

Tensions rise, particularly between Travis and Julian, as the second round begins. Each player must choose to stab the person next to them with an ice pick or whip Travis with a sjambok. Iris and Lucas choose to whip Travis out of fear, while Peter stabs Linda, resulting in her death. Amy stabs Iris, but she survives thanks to Lucas's intervention. Cal then whips Travis until he is incapacitated and removed from the game.

Amidst the chaos, Lucas creates a distraction, and everyone except Amy attempts to escape. Cal is shot, and killed during the escape attempt. Julian tries to rape Iris but is stabbed by her. Dr. Barden, having regretted his decision to involve Iris, tries to save her but is killed by Bevans. Iris is brought back to the game, and Shepard apologizes for his son's behavior.

The third round presents a choice between being submerged underwater for two minutes or picking a task from a card. Peter's card leads to his death from a heart attack caused by an explosive firecracker. Lucas slits his own eyeball as required by his card but survives. Iris chooses the barrel and survives, while Amy, who witnessed her husband drown their daughter, is forced into the barrel and drowns after not getting a chance to take a deep breath first. 

In the final round, only Iris and Lucas remain. Iris is given the choice to kill Lucas and win the game or spare him, resulting in no reward for either of them. After hesitation, Iris shoots Lucas, winning the game. Shepard declares her the champion, providing her with a bag of money to cover Raleigh's treatment and more. He reveals that a bone marrow donor has already been found for Raleigh in Romania.

However, upon returning home, Iris discovers that Raleigh has committed suicide, feeling like a burden. She realizes that the horrific acts she committed to win the money were all in vain. Overwhelmed with despair, Iris cries for the loss of her brother and the meaningless nature of her victory.

The film alternates between the years 1942 and 1990, between a family, with neuroscientist Lam Sik-ka, and his father Lam Sing, who was a translator for the Japanese occupational forces in Hong Kong. Sing has hidden the fact that in his past, he did not save a comfort woman from persecution by the occupiers. Sik-ka later learns that his father's death was caused by a curse the woman placed on him, and that the curse will eventually haunt him as well.

The documentary looks at Blackout, an immersive horror experience in which participants willingly take part in a haunted house type event.  The scares are tailored to their individual fears, which they relay to the event coordinators prior to fully entering the show. Acts performed on the participants will differ depending on the scares set up by the Blackout staff.  Performers are allowed to touch participants, unlike most other fright attractions, and participants are given a safe word if they grow too uncomfortable or scared.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10858098/the-blackout-experiments-review-haunted-house-sundance-2016|title=The Blackout Experiments takes you inside the most traumatic haunted house of all time|last=Bishop|first=Bryan|date=2016-01-28|website=The Verge|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref>

In the documentary, Fox interviews several of Blackout's repeat customers in order to understand why they continue to return to the event.  He captures their reactions to various frights, and for some, the news that they have attended too many Blackout events and are asked not to return.

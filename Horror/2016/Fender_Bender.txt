Hilary (Makenzie Vega), a 17-year-old girl, gets into a fender bender shortly after obtaining her driver's license. She innocently provides all of her information to the other driver (Bill Sage). When Hilary returns home, her parents are angry at her, though the stranger rear-ended her. As a result, they go on holiday without her, leaving her alone and vulnerable. Hilary invites her friends, Rachel and Erik, over and receives a text from the stranger. She has unwittingly become the next victim as the mysterious driver stalks her suburban home later that stormy night while Erik, Rachel, and she defend themselves. Complicating matters is Hilary's ex-boyfriend, who appears on the doorstep drunk.

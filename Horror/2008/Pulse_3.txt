Seven years into the invasion after Adam's (Rider Strong) Egyptian girlfriend Salwa (Noureen DeWulf) got hit by an infection, causing her to commit suicide, humankind has fled the cities, where billions have died from a plague that is spread through the Internet. Justine (Brittany Finamore) dreams of a life beyond her squalid refugee camp, where all technology is taboo. She discovers the last working laptop and opens it like Pandora's box. Someone is waiting for her online, and that someone wants desperately to meet her, who is revealed to be Adam through an Internet chat. The only catch: she must return to the city. With a longing that surpasses fear, Justine embarks on a terrifying journey back to the heart of where it all began. What waits there is something that she could not possibly have imagined. Towards the end of the movie, Justine reunites with Adam, but he was the only person who had not got the plague, resulting in him avoiding to care about "anything but himself". Justine smashes the working laptop and unplugs the USB flash drive from the slot, before encountering some Internet ghosts trying to get her. The unexpected explosions appear, making the ghosts disappear and go through Adam's body. He is then killed by the ghosts and the invasion ends with a voice-over from Justine.

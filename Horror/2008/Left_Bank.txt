Marie, an aspiring track star on her way to the European Championships, suffers a devastating setback when she is diagnosed with an immune infection and forced to rest. To pass the time, Marie moves in with Bobby, her charismatic new boyfriend who lives in a deluxe apartment in Antwerp's stylish Left Bank.

After learning the apartment's previous tenant mysteriously disappeared, Marie becomes obsessed with the mystery, all the while suffering from headaches, nausea, tension and insomnia. As Bobby dismisses her theories and fears, Marie delves deeper into her investigation, growing suspicious of her loving boyfriend and the ritzy building, whose long-hidden secrets have frightening consequences.

As the police close in and begin to investigate several mysterious deaths, it is revealed that Bobby is part of an ancient religious cult that celebrates rebirth and enacts a mysterious ritual every seven years on Samhain. As the day of the ritual approaches, Marie tries to leave, but Bobby catches her and drags her back. The cult enacts the ritual, forcing Marie into a black watery pit. As she passes through, she experiences a vision and then takes rebirth as a baby as she is reborn in the arms of her new parents.

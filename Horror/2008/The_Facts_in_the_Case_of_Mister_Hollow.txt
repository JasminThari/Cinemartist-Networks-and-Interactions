The film opens with a brief pan over several papers, one of which shows a symbol resembling the Caduceus but with bat wings and the one word question "Keres"? The film then shows a news clipping with a headline that states that a child has disappeared and is believed to be one of an estimated 100 victims. A by-line shown in the same clipping mentions that paganism is currently flourishing in northern Ontario. Along with the clipping is a note that comments that enclosed with the clipping is a photograph and that the reader should look closely at it. The photo initially shows four adults, three men and one woman, standing in a forest with a house looming at their back and a car on their left. The woman is holding an infant and initially nothing seems odd about the photo. 
The majority of the film follows, as the camera zooms in and pans across the photo repeatedly. With each pass of the camera, details of the scene shift and become more sinister: some are merely points of interest that could easily be missed, such as markings on the hands of the three adult males, a car mirror showing blood spatters and a body in the car's back seat, and crosses nailed to trees. Others are more obvious, such as one of the men beginning to light a fire made up of several crucifixes. Eventually the photo reveals two additional people in the background, two priests holding a shotgun that appears to be ready to fire upon the group. As the short concludes it becomes apparent that the woman is not there of her own volition—her expression having become horrified in the most recent examination—and the film ends with the revelation that there is a final person in the image, a cloaked and menacing figure reflected in the sunglasses worn by one of the men.

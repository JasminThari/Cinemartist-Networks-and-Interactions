Based on the Imperium Comics series of the same name, ''Trailer Park of Terror'' follows six troubled high school students and their leader, the optimistic youth ministries pastor, Lewis (Matthew Del Negro). As the group return from an outdoor character building retreat in the mountains they become lost on the back roads after their bus crashes during a raging storm. The luckless group seeks refuge for the night in a seemingly abandoned trailer park down the road, managed by the strange and seductive Norma (Nichole Hiltz). As the night progresses they find that the park is anything but empty as Norma and her undead trailer trash buddies pick them off in imaginative ways.

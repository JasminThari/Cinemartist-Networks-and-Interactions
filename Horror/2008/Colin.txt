Injured in the arm, Colin arrives home to the house he shares with Damien only to find it empty. While cleaning his wound in the kitchen sink, he is attacked by Damien, now a zombie. He manages to "kill" Damien by stabbing him multiple times in the head with a kitchen knife, but soon afterward becomes a zombie himself. Now a zombie, Colin wanders the streets of London during the onset of a zombie apocalypse. He acquires the usual zombie cannibal taste for human flesh but avoids conflict. While being mugged for his trainers, he is seen by his sister Linda, who rescues him. That evening zombies invade a house party and kill everyone within. Colin follows the sole survivor of the carnage before she is trapped by a madman / serial killer in his basement with a group of blinded zombies.

Linda and a friend take Colin to their mother's house, but he cannot recognize them. Linda was bitten by Colin when she saved him from the muggers and turns into a zombie. She reanimates locked in the kitchen with Colin. In a fit of anger and grief, her boyfriend beats up (dead) Colin, who just shambles away.

The film also follows a group of human survivors who go on the offensive. Led by Slingshot Guy, the humans attack a large group of zombies with homemade weapons and a makeshift bomb. It explodes near Colin, destroying his hearing and most of his face. Three of the humans are bitten during the fight and plead for their lives before being brutally killed by the rest of the group because they will turn.

Colin finds his way to his friend Laura's home, where the film cuts to a flashback to when he was still human. Arriving at the house, he discovered that Laura had trapped a zombie in the bathroom. While attempting to kill the zombie, she was bitten and died in his arms, before reanimating and biting him. He then killed her before going home, which brings the viewer back to the film's beginning.<ref>Michael Brooke: "Review: Colin:" Sight and Sound: November 2009: 19:11: 52-53</ref>

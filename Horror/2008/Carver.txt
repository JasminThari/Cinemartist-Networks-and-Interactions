A group of young campers take a detour through the mountain town of ''Halcyon Ridge'', and stop at a bar where the owner asks them for help getting supplies from their storehouse in the woods. When they get there, they discover bizarre snuff films which, unbeknownst to them, are real. They soon become the targets of two homicidal brothers with an insatiable bloodlust.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Carver--UNRATED-Kristyn-Green/dp/B001139ZE2/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1292099448&sr=1-1 |title=Amazon,com- Carver |website=Amazon |date= 4 March 2008|accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/carver/ |title=Reviews |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/6415/carver-dvd/ |title=Carver (DVD) |work=DreadCentral |first=Steve |last=Barton |date=March 1, 2008 |access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>

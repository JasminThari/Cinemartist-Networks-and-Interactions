When Karla brings her father Hans in Mallorca to a clinic because he was stung by a bee, it does not look good for him. The doctors want to find just a normal bee sting, but Karla does not consider it feasible. Together with the researcher Ben she gets down to find the true culpritâ€”and finds oversized bees, which are also extremely aggressive. This new insect species is a major threat to thousands of people on the holiday island.

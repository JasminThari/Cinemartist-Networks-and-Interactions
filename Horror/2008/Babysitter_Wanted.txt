Angie Albright starts college in a town far away from home and her deeply religious mother. Her college roommate likes to indulge in smoking weed, and in trying to escape that, Angie finds a job as a babysitter. The couple who live on the outlying farm of Stanton have a son named Sam who is quiet and loves to wear a cowboy outfit, even when sleeping. The couple seems sweet and charming and they offer Angie a job, asking if she is free to babysit Sam the following Saturday night. Angie accepts

She also meets a guy named Rick who she has frequent run-ins with around the campus. On the day of the night that Angie has to babysit, her car quits unexpectedly. Rick offers to fix Angie's car and gives her a ride to the couple's house. As soon as the couple leaves, Angie is disturbed by a series of mysterious phone calls. The prank caller turns out to be a priest who came to kill Sam after knowing Sam's secret, but he is killed by the couple. Sam is then revealed to have two small horns on his head, which he uses the cowboy costume to cover, and is revealed to be the son of the devil. The couple then reveal that they trap young females as Sam only eats human female flesh. The husband, Jim Stanton, then brings back a sedated girl to his tool shed, where he also ties up Angie.

Angie watches in horror and attempts to escape while Stan is precisely marking the other girl for slaughtering. Angie eventually escapes, killing the couple in the process, and injures Sam. When she wakes up in the hospital, the cops inform her that there was no body of a child, meaning Sam wasn't dead.

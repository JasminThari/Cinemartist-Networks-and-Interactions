High school freshman Donna Keppel returns home one evening to find her father and younger brother have been murdered. She hides under her brother's bed where she then witnesses her mother stabbed to death by Richard Fenton, her former biology teacher who had become obsessed with Donna.

Three years later, Donna lives with her Uncle Jack and Aunt Karen. She and her friends prepare for their senior prom. Meanwhile, Detective Winn, who arrested Fenton three years earlier, learns Fenton has escaped from the mental hospital.

Knowing Fenton will come for Donna, Winn arrives at the hotel with his partner Detective Nash. Fenton breaks into the friends' shared hotel suite, where he first kills Donna's friends Claire and Michael. Later, Donna's other friend Lisa and her boyfriend Ronnie bump into Fenton on their way up to the suite; Lisa recognizes him but cannot recall from where. Soon, she realizes it's the assailant and runs to warn Donna, only to be trapped in the stairwell by Fenton. He chases her into the basement, where he slits her throat.

Winn finds the body of the man whose name Fenton has been using in his car trunk in the parking lot. Winn then goes up to the room Fenton booked and finds the housekeeper's body. As he has the hotel evacuated, Donna goes back up to her room to find Lisa and retrieve her mother's shawl, where she runs into Fenton and escapes. The SWAT team search the hotel but find no sign of Fenton.

Donna and her boyfriend Bobby are escorted back to Donna's house, where Winn orders back up protection. Inside, Donna discovers Bobby's throat was slashed. She retreats to her closet to hide, only to find Fenton inside already. He prevents her from screaming as Winn enters her room. They struggle; as Fenton is about to stab her, Winn shoots Fenton several times, killing him.

As Donna is joined by her Aunt and Uncle, Winn consoles her and tells her it is over.

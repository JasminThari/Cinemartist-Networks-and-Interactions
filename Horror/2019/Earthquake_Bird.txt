Set in 1989 Tokyo, Japan, Lucy Fly is a young Swedish female immigrant who is working as a translator at a manufacturing company, and is suspected of murder when her friend Lily goes missing in the wake of a tumultuous love triangle with Teiji Matsuda.

The plot of the film is interspersed with flashbacks of Lucy's childhood, as well as scenes of her romantic relationship with Teiji and friendship with Lily Bridges, an American expatriate. Teiji's hobby includes taking photographs of nature scenes such as water reflections and abandoned buildings. When Teiji first meets Lucy, he says he rarely takes photos of people, yet wants to take her portrait. Teiji has a peculiar habit of locking his favorite photos away in a filing cabinet rather than displaying them to the public. 

During a vacation to Sado Island, Lucy's friendship with Lily sours when she discovers that Teiji has begun a romantic relationship with Lily behind her back. Following the disappearance of Lily, Lucy is arrested and interrogated by Japanese detectives. Lucy claims that she murdered Lily in a fit of jealous rage, but is cleared after the body is identified as belonging to someone else. After being released, Lucy discovers evidence in Teiji's photo collection implicating him in Lily's murder and disappearance. Teiji attacks Lucy but she kills him in self-defense.

The film ends with Lucy in a cemetery with her Japanese friend Ms. Kato, reflecting on the past.

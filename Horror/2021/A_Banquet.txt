A woman, Holly, is taking care of her very sick husband. He drinks poison to kill himself. Her daughter, Betsey, is preparing to apply to go to university, but is unsure of what to focus her studies on. A guidance counselor asks her to make of list of what she thinks is most important. Later, she goes to a party and wanders off into the woods. After she returns, she refuses to eat, but claims to have had visions of a dark future, but one in which also she is special and her mother is a star. Although she does not seem to lose weight, her mother, distraught, takes her to doctors and specialists and empties out her bank account trying to find someone who can help. 

Holly's mother visits and tells her of the Japanese legend of the Futakuchi-onna and suggests that is what Betsey is: a monster who is feeding off of Holly's family. She offers to take Holly's younger daughter, Izzy, if she wants to escape what is happening, which she does. Betsey tells her mother that something is coming, and no matter what happens she should love and support her through it. They pass a terrible night together, and in the morning Betsey tells her mother that her love made everything possible. She dies. Holly, distraught, wanders out into the street. Stricken by grief, she collapses, but then appears to glow with a strange light.

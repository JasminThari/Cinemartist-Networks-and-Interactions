After suffering a stroke at her 70th birthday party, Judith Albright, a professional dancer in her youth who is now a dance instructor, is moved into a nursing home after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Her 17-year-old grandson, Josh, whom she is very close to, opposes the move, while his mother, Judithâ€™s daughter, Barbara, tries to comfort him. Judith assures Josh that the move is best for everyone. But soon she notices strange behaviors and the deaths of other residents. She imagines a tree like figure looming in her room. Eventually, it is revealed that three of the other elderly people living there are much older even and have been using witchcraft to suck the life forces out of victims (patients of the Manor). This allows them to become young every nightfall, returning to their old forms when the sun rises. Judith decides to join them in the end so that she may live longer to have time with Josh, who also comes to work at the Manor.

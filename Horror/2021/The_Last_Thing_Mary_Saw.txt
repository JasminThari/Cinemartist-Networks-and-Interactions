Southold, New York, 1843. Young Mary (Stefanie Scott), blood trickling from behind the blindfold tied around her eyes, is interrogated about the events surrounding the death of her family's matriarch (Judith Roberts). As the story jumps back in time, we witness Mary, raised in a repressively religious household, finding fleeting happiness in the arms of Eleanor (Isabelle Fuhrman), the home’s maid. Her family view the girls’ relationship as an abomination to be dealt with as severely as possible, with the tension only heightened by the arrival of an enigmatic intruder (Rory Culkin) and the revelation of greater forces at work.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Gingold|title=''The Last Thing Mary Saw''|website=Fantasia Film Festival|url=https://2021.fantasiafestival.com/en/film/the-last-thing-mary-saw|accessdate=September 6, 2022}}</ref>

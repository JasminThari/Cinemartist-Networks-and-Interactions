A dilapidated detached house is located in the heart of the forest in Sydänmaa; the childhood home of the now grown-up main characters, Mikko (Pekka Strang), Maria (Inka Kallén) and Matilda (Saana Koivisto), to which they return years later to settle their parents' estate. The house and the forest are overshadowed by a dark history: 15 years earlier, the father (Niko Saarela) was found brutally murdered in the house, the mother (Olga Temonen) was declared missing at the time, and the youngest of the children, Matilda, was wheeled into a small cage in the corner of the bedroom. When they get there, they notice that the forest makes them behave strangely. Will the environment bring out the siblings' childhood traumas, or will something supernatural happen in the forest that belonged to their missing mother's family? And what the growth rings of trees have to do with this? As darkness descends, the events of the past begin to repeat themselves and no one is safe.

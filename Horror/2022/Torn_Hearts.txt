A country music duo seek out the private mansion of their idol and end up in a twisted series of horrors that force them to confront the limits they'd go for their dreams. Leigh (Alexxis Lemire) and Jordan (Abby Quinn), singer and songwriter, respectively, together constitute the Nashville band “Torn Hearts.” On the rise, they are looking for a break on the tour of a famed country singer, Caleb Crawford (Shiloh Fernandez), who, after Jordan hooks up with him for a night, tells her that the tour is “all-guys.” With this chance gone, Jordan talks Leigh into approaching their idol, Harper Dutch (Katey Sagal), of the Dutch Sisters, whose address Jordan got from Caleb, and recording a song with her.

After reaching the old and worn-out Dutch manor, Leigh and Jordan receive an odd welcome from Harper Dutch. Her sister Hope Dutch (the other half of their band, the Dutch Sisters), was murdered when they were young and famous, after which Harper left singing.

Harper is able to spark a fight between Leigh and Jordan by poking at their difference of opinions.  Leigh even admitted to Harper that she “picked” Jordan after “four or five” girls. This is where Harper connects with her and not Jordan.

Just like Leigh knew that she wouldn’t have achieved whatever she had without Jordan, Harper, too, knew that without Hope, success wouldn’t have come to her. Jordan shoots and kills Harper in self defense, but by then, Harper has already been able to plant the “story” seed inside Leigh’s head. With Jordan dead, Leigh, too, would have a tragic story to tell the world that would make more people listen to their songs. Before Leigh can leave the Dutch manor, a fatally wounded Jordan shoots Leigh, and they both die.

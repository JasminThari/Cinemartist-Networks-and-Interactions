When Ambar and Dika leave their home after their parents’ death, the siblings never imagine that what was supposedly a new start would turn out to be the beginning of their greatest misery. The fateful events to come are fueled by Ambar’s ability to sense the unseen, acquired after her vision began to fail. Despite the warm welcome they receive at a retirement home, Ambar sees an eerie vision of the past. She learns that a slaughter took place in the house many years before. A Dutch woman, Ivanna, appears in Ambar’s vision. She glimpses  the tragedy of Ivanna's decapitation by a vile imperialist.

On the day of Eid al-Fitr, grandma Ani is found beheaded in a gruesome pool of blood. Ambar realizes that the tragedy may be related to her earlier discovery of a chest filled with trinkets and a headless statue in the basement of the nursing home.

The film follows Lyra, who works shifts at a shadowy online content moderation office where employees, known as deleters, are tasked with the process of filtering graphic uploads from reaching social media platforms. The responsibility of censorship proves bearable for Lyra, whom her co-workers, as well as her boss Simon, observe as a cold person unfazed by the disturbing imagery she sees on a daily basis. What they do not know is that Lyra hides a deep trauma. Lyraâ€™s attempt to erase and forget her past has forced her to maintain an apathetic face to the horrors of the world.<ref name=luster>{{Citation |last1=Ramachandran |first1=Naman |last2=Frater |first2=Patrick |title=Nadine Lustre in 'Deleter': Watch First Teaser for Mikhail Red's Techno-Horror Film (EXCLUSIVE) |date=26 September 2022 |url=https://variety.com/2022/film/asia/nadine-lustre-deleter-mikhail-red-teaser-1235383049/ |website=Variety |access-date=27 September 2022 |archive-date=February 4, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230204102600/https://variety.com/2022/film/asia/nadine-lustre-deleter-mikhail-red-teaser-1235383049/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=july>{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/video-nadine-lustre-content-moderator-deleter-teaser/|title=WATCH: Nadine Lustre as a content moderator in chilling 'Deleter' teaser|publisher=Rappler|date=September 27, 2022|access-date=October 1, 2022|archive-date=October 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221001150232/https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/video-nadine-lustre-content-moderator-deleter-teaser/|url-status=live}}</ref>

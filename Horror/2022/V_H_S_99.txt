The film is presented as a mixtape of five different narratives set in 1999. Unlike in the previous ''V/H/S'' entries, the film does not have an overarching frame narrative in between each short. Instead, short stop-motion animations of toy soldiers — made by Brady from "The Gawkers" — serve as interludes.

Jane (Julia Barreto) travels with her husband Marco (Xian Lim) to go to Pola, Oriental Mindoro to seek the mayor's approval to demolish Jane's ancestral house. The caretaker gives them a tour of the home and Jane feels that something's amiss when they reach the basement.

The next day, Jane is informed that the buyer has backed out due to the local council's plans to designate the home as a national historical site. In her plan to reverse the decision, she meets her ex-lover, Anton (Marco Gumabao), who works as an assistant to the mayor. A series of events occur in the house - one event makes Jane's belly become bigger and bigger as if she is pregnant. <ref>{{Cite news |last=Wang |first=Nickie |date=February 16, 2022 |title=Julia Barretto, Xian Lim pair up in Brillante Mendozaâ€™s new horror movie |work=Manila Standard |url=https://manilastandard.net/showbitz/columns0/very-wang-by-nickie-wang/314207987/julia-barretto-xian-lim-pair-up-in-brillante-mendozas-new-horror-movie.html |access-date=July 8, 2022}}</ref>

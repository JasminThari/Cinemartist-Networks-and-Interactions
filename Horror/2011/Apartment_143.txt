A parapsychology team is asked to investigate the White family in Apartment 143. Alan White (Kai Lennox) has lost his wife initially explained as being to an unspecified illness, but later clarified as an automobile accident during a psychotic episode. The family started to experience strange events shortly after the death, and relocated from their prior home to the apartment to escape them. The move was initially successful, but after about a week strange incidents resumed in the new location.

The team consists of Dr. Helzer (Michael O'Keefe), Paul Ortega (Rick Gonzalez), and the technician, Ellen Keegan (Fiona Glascott). After they set up their equipment, they get some compelling evidence on camera.<ref>{{Citation |title=Apartment 143 (2011) - IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1757742/reviews |access-date=2023-05-04}}</ref>

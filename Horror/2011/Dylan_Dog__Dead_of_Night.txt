In New Orleans, Dylan Dog, a paranormal detective, recounts his past experiences helping people with supernatural cases until his wife was killed by vampires. He currently works on regular cases with his partner, Marcus Deckler.

When Elizabeth Ryan finds her father dead and is attacked by a strange creature, she seeks Dylan's help. Initially reluctant, Dylan changes his mind after Marcus is killed by the same creature. He begins investigating and identifies the killer as an eighteen- to nineteen-year-old werewolf from the Cysnos clan. Dylan suspects Gabriel's daughter, Mara, and visits Gabriel, an old friend. Gabriel's son, Wolfgang, attacks Dylan but is defeated.

Dylan discovers Mara's body in a warehouse and encounters a vampire. Elizabeth reveals her father's missing artifact, linking it to the vampire attacks. Dylan and Elizabeth are later attacked by vampires demanding "The Heart." They escape and continue their investigation.

At the morgue, Dylan finds Marcus turned into a zombie. Dylan takes Marcus and Elizabeth to a black market for body parts, where they learn that vampires, led by Vargas, seek "The Heart." Dylan confronts Vargas at a nightclub but gets no answers.

Dylan consults his vampire friend, Borelli, who reveals that "The Heart" is the "Heart of Belial," a relic containing the blood of an ancient monster. Dylan retrieves the relic from a vampire elder's tomb but is captured by Vargas. Vargas admits to killing Dylan's wife and takes the Heart before trapping Dylan and Marcus in a crypt.

After escaping, Dylan and Marcus pursue Vargas, who plans to turn Elizabeth into a vampire with Belial's blood. Dylan realizes Elizabeth is the true enemy and wants revenge for her father's death. He confronts her at the Corpus House and battles Belial, who possesses Vargas. Elizabeth is attacked by Wolfgang and his werewolf allies, ultimately killing her. Belial dies, leaving Vargas unconscious.

Dylan entrusts the Heart to Wolfgang and decides to revive his paranormal detective agency, partnering with Marcus once again.

Liu Cheng-Hao (Wu Kang-ren), producer of a supernatural tv show, is successful in both life and love: not only is work going smoothly, but him and his fiancee (Nikki Hsieh) live together happily. After Cheng-Hao picks up a strange red envelope in the park, however, he begins to have recurrent nightmares about an old house.

Senior high school student Yin-Yin (Vera Yen) has had the Yin and Yang eye ({{zh|陰陽眼}}); since she was little, she has been able to see things that are not really there. However, recently the monstrosities appearing before her have become increasingly severe.

All clues point to the old house deep in the mountains that has been forgotten long ago.

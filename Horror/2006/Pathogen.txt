Fourteen-year-old Dannie (Rose Kent-McGlew) is horrified when a waterborne disease caused by bacteria begins to spread, but believes that the disease is somehow linked to her recurring dreams. As the disease becomes an epidemic, it's revealed that the disease not only kills those it infects but also turns them into zombies. As Dannie and her friends try to find the solution to the disease, they come across researcher Sue, who might hold the key to both the zombie disease and Dannie's dreams.

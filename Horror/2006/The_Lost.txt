19-year-old Ray Pye decides to murder two young women. His friends, Jen and Tim, witness the murder and help him cover it up.

Four years later, Ray has never been arrested for the crime. Detective Charlie Schilling and his ex-partner, Ed Anderson, know that Ray did it but they could not prove it. Charlie figures it is about time they did something about it. Meanwhile, Ray has met his match in Katherine Wallace, a new girl in town. She and Ray are a potentially explosive combination. Throw in the fact that Ed is having a summer fling with Sally Richmond - a girl young enough to be his daughter. And Sally has just gotten a job at the motel that Ray manages. Ray has his eye on her.

Charlie and Ed never found the gun that Ray used to murder the women at the campground. That rifle, as well as a handgun, are hidden behind the mirror in Ray's bathroom. Ray can only be pushed so far. The time will come when he takes the mirror off the wall and shows everyone who is in charge.

Dr. Bela Reinhardt (Ron Chaney) is a mad doctor who has invited five people to his castle to determine which of them shall inherit his estate. He has arranged for a competition of sorts. The winner will be chosen by process of...elimination.
The visitors quickly realize they have made a terrible mistake in accepting Reinhardt's invitation, but are trapped like rats in a cage under the watchful eye of Reinhardt's ghoulish manservant, Barlow. They soon discover the castle is full of terrifying monsters such as the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/features/21-fearful-features/4134-exclusive-coverage-fango-attends-the-house-of-the-wolf-man-world-premiere.html |title=Exclusive Coverage: Fango attends the HOUSE OF THE WOLF MAN World Premiere! |last=Jankiewicz |first=Pat |date=2009-10-02 |website=Fangoria |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004234741/http://www.fangoria.com/features/21-fearful-features/4134-exclusive-coverage-fango-attends-the-house-of-the-wolf-man-world-premiere.html |archive-date=2009-10-04 |access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>

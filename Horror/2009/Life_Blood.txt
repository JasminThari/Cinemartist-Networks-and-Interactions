On New Year's Eve 1968, lesbian couple Brooke and Rhea encounter the Creator of the Universe while driving on the Pearblossom Highway as they leave a party, after Brooke killed a rapist. The women are laid to rest for 40 years and awaken as vampires on New Year's Day 2009 .

Instructed to devour evil and thereby gain eternal life, the story portrays their first 24 hours of survival as vampiric creatures. Brooke starts to go on a killing spree to prove herself loyal to the Creator, while Rhea tries to put a stop to the chaos that Brooke started after she kills a sheriff, his deputies, a married couple on vacation, and a hitch-hiker.

When Brooke prefers to devour good souls instead of evil souls, Rhea kills Brooke by impaling her with a stop sign. Rhea decides to start her vampire life all over again after telling her story to Lizzy, not knowing that Brooke is still alive, presumably plotting her revenge.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barton |first1=Steve |title=Teaser Trailer and Art for Pearblossom |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/14179/teaser-trailer-and-art-for-pearblossom/ |website=Dread Central |date=October 31, 2009}}</ref>

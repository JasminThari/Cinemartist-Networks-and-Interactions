The film follows a struggling rock band called the Winners as they tour across Canada and the United States. After band member Jennifer is turned into a vampire, the band quickly gains a following of groupies attracted to her newfound beauty. As their infamy grows, the vampire hunter Eddie Van Helsing learns that Jennifer is a vampire and vows to hunt her down.

While on tour, the band members are each turned into vampires, one by one. Although the band continues to grow in popularity, band member Joey loses interest in the vampire lifestyle after accidentally killing their producer, Victor, and eventually convinces Jennifer that they should become human again. After a brief altercation, Eddie agrees to help the band upon hearing of their plans to become human. They track down Queenie, the vampire who turned Jennifer, intending to kill him. During the fight, Queenie kills Sam and nearly kills Eddie, before he is stabbed in the heart by Joey. The band members become human again as a result of his death, and they happily return home.

Six months later, Joey and Jennifer are shown to have grown bored with their human lives in suburbia. They are approached by a bartender who had previously served at their gigs; he reveals himself to be an entity more powerful even than Queenie (the implication being that the bartender is Satan himself) and he offers them the opportunity to be even more powerful and more famous than they were as vampires. It is implied that Joey and Jennifer accept the offer, despite the chaos caused during their time as vampires.

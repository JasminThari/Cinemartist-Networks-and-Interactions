The film opens of an exterior of a house in the suburbs. In it, a young woman known only as "The Girl" is dancing around a house after preparing breakfast for herself. "The Girl" enters a bedroom and finds a man and a dead woman tied to chairs. The Girl acts shocked, but then it is revealed that she was the one who had captured and tortured this couple, killing a female relative and possibly their baby as well. The Girl finishes the husband off by stabbing him in the chest with a tap, collecting the blood that drips from it in a wine glass. The Girl then claims two more victims, an elderly woman whose medication she tampers with, and a high school student who she drowns in a bathtub after several unsuccessful attempts to electrocute her. The Girl moves forward to stalking Don Carpenter, a stoner and member of a band who lives alone, so The Girl easily captures him, and imprisons him in his recording studio basement.

The Girl tortures and mutilates Don, and gives him drugs that cause him to experience hallucinations and flashbacks. Don's friends, band mates, and ex-girlfriend are also captured and tortured to death by The Girl. Eventually growing bored with Don, The Girl strangles him (inexplicably beginning to cry while doing so) as he weakly tries to do the same to her. Don's body and those of his friends are posed around the basement by The Girl, who then goes upstairs, where a party that Don had been planning is in full swing. The Girl greets the guests, leaves the house, and dances down the street.

As the credits roll, Mike, one of Don's band mates who had seemingly died when The Girl tricked him into drinking drain cleaner, awakens, coughs up the chemicals, and screams for help when he realizes that he is now blind.

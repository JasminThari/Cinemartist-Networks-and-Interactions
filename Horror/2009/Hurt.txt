The Coltrane family's life has been devastated by an untimely death. Widowed Helen Coltrane (Melora Walters), along with her teenage son (Jackson Rathbone) and daughter, are given shelter by her reclusive and quirky gun-loving brother-in-law. As they grapple with the reality of their shattered, altered life and twist of fate, coincidence steps in with a seemingly lovely foster child (Sofia Vassilieva), who appears touting a story that Helen's husband had pledged to take her in. A macabre story of deception unfolds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montereymedia.com/independent/hurt.html|title="hurt" DVD - Monstereyemedia|date=November 9, 2009|publisher=Monster Eye Media|accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref>

A girl named Amy falls in love with the new boy in town. Dan is a drifter from out of town who carries a dark secret with him.

In the beginning Amy's friends tell her to go talk to Dan, who is working in an auto shop. He treats Amy with disinterest until he realizes that he has hurt her feelings. He asks to give her a ride home. Amy's father doesn't trust Dan from the beginning. Dan's a drifter, so people automatically don't trust him. But, the reason people don't trust him is because of the vibes he gives off. Amy and Dan get to know each other as the movie progresses. Meanwhile, Dan's father, Bender, is out killing people only a few states over. Dan's dad eventually shows up and kills a dog along with a horse. Sam, the local sheriff and Amy's dad, investigate the murders and eventually connect them to the killings from other states. The two eventually discover Charles Thibodeaux. Charles tells them that he knows Bender from a while ago and Bender is a werewolf. Charles put Bender in jail a while back, and he escaped seeking revenge. Bender killed Charles' wife brutally and Charles never got over it.

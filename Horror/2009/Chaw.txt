The quiet town of Sammaeri near Mount Jiri has been crime-free for a decade until now. Bodies of villagers begin turning up, making the village leaders nervous just ahead of an organic food fair expected to be a financial windfall. Chun Il-man (Jang Hang-sun), whose granddaughter was one of the victims, is sure that a man-killing boar is behind the crimes. He joins forces with detective Shin (Park Hyuk-kwon) and Kim Kang-soo (Uhm Tae-woong), a reassigned cop from Seoul whose mother has gone missing in the woods. With Byun Soo-ryun (Jung Yu-mi), a biologist studying wild animals, and glory-seeking hunter Baek Man-bae (Yoon Je-moon) on the team to fight the giant killer beast, the five start up the mountain to face their enemy.<ref>{{cite web|title=2009.7.17 NOW PLAYING|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2907516|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711161432/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2907516|url-status=usurped|archive-date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Korea Joongang Daily|date=17 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Chaw|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940755?refcatid=31|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Variety|date=30 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=yna>{{cite web|last=Shin|first=Hae-in|title=Full of wit and humor, monster flick draws laughter rather than chills|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2009/07/09/95/0703000000AEN20090709001500315F.HTML|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Yonhap|date=9 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Chaw Explores Omnivore's Nightmare|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/07/141_48183.html|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=The Korea Times|date=9 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Kyu Hyun|title=Chaw|url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm09.html#chaw|work=Koreanfilm.org|accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>

He believes it may have a connection to an enigmatic tree that now haunts his dreams. Sean's friends (Adam Green and Edoardo Beghi), along with two young women, accompany him on his quest. Things soon turn deadly as Satinka, a beautiful and vengeful spirit, wreaks her revenge for an unspeakable crime committed over 200 years ago. This hurls the group into a foreboding ecological nightmare, on a road straight to Hell.

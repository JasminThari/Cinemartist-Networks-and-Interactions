High school senior Ethan has a crush on his childhood friend, Kahlah.  Ethan believes that Kahlah's boyfriend, Shane, is dangerous, but he does not know how to tell her without seeming to be crazy.  Annoyed by her reluctance to have sex with him, Shane drugs and accidentally kills Kahlah.  Convinced that Shane is guilty, Ethan uses his anthropologist neighbor's knowledge of voodoo to raise Kahlah from the dead as a zombie so that she can help him prove Shane's guilt.

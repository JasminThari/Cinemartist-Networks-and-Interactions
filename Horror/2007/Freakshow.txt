A gang of thieves works as security guards in a traveling carnival. They plot to steal the rich owner's fortune.

Lucy, one of the thieves, attempts to take the fortune by herself by seducing the Boss and marrying him. The youngest member of the Freakshow, Kimmie stumbles across a few of the gang members stealing food and she is murdered by the thieves. When the murder is discovered, the freaks plot revenge. In a variety of gruesome ways, the thieves are murdered by the freaks. Lucy attempts to escape punishment by swearing her love for the carnival Boss. The freaks "spare" her by giving her a Freakshow "act" which will make her a full member of their troupe. They mutilate her, cut out her tongue, sew her mouth shut, strip her flesh, and cut off her limbs before finally displaying her in the Freakshow Gallery as the "Worm Girl".

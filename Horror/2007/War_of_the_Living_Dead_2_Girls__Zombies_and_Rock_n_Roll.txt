An unexplained phenomenon causes a zombie pandemic.  Jim and Nick, workers at a car rental service in Louisville, Kentucky, attempt to survive the zombie apocalypse.  With the help of April, Dick, Vix, and several other friends and locals that they pick up along the way, the group makes its way through the city.  Eventually, they manage to rally a large number of bikers, who proceed to fight the zombies in a thousand-person brawl.

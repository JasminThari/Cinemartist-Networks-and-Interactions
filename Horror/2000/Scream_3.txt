Cotton Weary, now the host of a successful talk show, is contacted by Ghostface, who demands to know the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott. When Cotton refuses to cooperate, Ghostface breaks into his home and attacks his girlfriend Christine. Cotton rushes home, only for Ghostface to kill Christine, then Cotton.

Detective Mark Kincaid contacts Gale Weathers to discuss the recent murders, prompting her to travel to Hollywood, where she finds Dewey Riley working as an adviser on the set of ''Stab 3'', the third film in the series based on the Ghostface murders. Ghostface kills ''Stab 3'' actress Sarah Darling, causing production of the film to be halted. The remaining cast, along with Dewey and Gale, gather at the home of Jennifer Jolie, the actress playing Gale in ''Stab 3''. Ghostface murders her bodyguard and uses a gas leak to cause an explosion, which kills actor Tom Prinze.

Sidney is living in seclusion as a crisis counselor for an abused women's hotline, fearing another killer may strike. Having uncovered Sidney's location, the killer begins taunting her by phone using a voice changer to sound like her deceased mother Maureen Prescott, forcing Sidney out of hiding and drawing her to Hollywood. Martha Meeks, the sister of Sidney's murdered friend Randy,{{efn|name=Scream2|As depicted in ''Scream 2'' (1997)}} visits Sidney and the others to deliver a videotape that Randy made before his death, posthumously warning them the rules of a horror film do not apply to anyone in the third and final film of a trilogy and that any of them, including Sidney, could die. Sidney is later attacked by Ghostface at a movie set, forcing the police to withhold her at their station.

Dewey, Gale, Jennifer, and the remaining cast, Angelina{{efn|In an early version of the script, Angelina was a second Ghostface, Roman's lover and accomplice, with the original draft elaborating that she was a former classmate of Sidney's from Woodsboro whose real name was Angie Crick. Her motivation was stated as her idolizing Sidney and wanting her fame and attention, thus her having taken on the role of Sidney in the ''Stab'' film, and giving Roman's and Sidney's relationship incestuous vibes. The idea was later scrapped, Craven mentioning in the film's director's commentary that they could not get the studio on board with the idea. Editor Patrick Lussier and producer Marianne Maddalena left it ambiguous as to whether Angelina was actually dead due to being dragged off, discussing the idea in the film's commentary. They called her death scene "dubious". In a subsequent Scream Trilogy DVD boxset booklet, Angelina is not listed as a deceased character from Scream 3. This may have just been an oversight, but fans have speculated it is connected to all this other information about the plan to have her as a killer. ''Scream VI'', however, lists Roman Bridger as the only Ghostface in the Hollywood killings, implying Angelina was not involved at all{{snd}}or at least, if she was, that information never came to light.<ref>{{cite video|people=Craven, Wes (Director), Marianne Maddalena (Producer) and Patrick Lussier (Editor)|date=February 2, 2000|title=Scream 3: Commentary|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084|medium=DVD|publisher=Dimension Films|location=United States|access-date=August 15, 2011|archive-date=May 31, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531032931/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084|url-status=live}}</ref>}} and Tyson, attend a birthday party for ''Stab 3''{{'}}s director, Roman Bridger. After Gale discovers Roman's body in the basement, Ghostface attacks the group, killing Angelina, Tyson and Jennifer. The killer then orders Sidney to the mansion to save Gale and Dewey. When Sidney arrives, Ghostface lures her inside to where Gale and Dewey are bound and gagged. As Sidney is freeing them, Ghostface appears, though Sidney gains the upper hand using a hidden gun to fight him off. Kincaid shows up but is knocked unconscious by Ghostface. Sidney flees and hides in a secret screening room where she is discovered by Ghostface, who reveals himself as Roman, having survived being shot by wearing a bulletproof vest. 

Roman admits to being Sidney's half-brother, born to their mother Maureen when she was an actress in Hollywood. Four years prior, he had tried reuniting with her, only for her to reject him due to him being the product of rape. Bitter over the rejection, Roman began stalking her, filming all the men she philandered with and showing Billy Loomis the footage of Billy's father with Maureen, which motivated Billy and Stu Macher to kill her, thus setting off the string of murders in Sidney's hometown{{efn|As depicted in ''Scream'' (1996)}} and at her college.{{efn|name=Scream2}} When he discovered how much fame Sidney had attracted due to those events, Roman snapped and lured Sidney out of hiding, planning to kill her and frame her for the murders. After Roman kills ''Stab'' producer John Milton, whom he accuses of being his biological father and one of their mother's rapists, Sidney furiously denounces him and rightfully justifies his motives are by his own choices, provoking an enraged Roman to engage Sidney in a fight that ends when Roman shoots Sidney in the chest; however, Sidney survives the shot and stabs Roman multiple times, revealing to him that she, too, was wearing a bulletproof vest. As Dewey and Gale arrive, a screaming Roman suddenly recklessly resurfaces with a knife; Sidney yells at Dewey to shoot Roman in the head, which Dewey does, finally killing him.

Later at Sidney's house, Dewey proposes to Gale, who accepts. Sidney returns from a walk and leaves her gates, which were previously shown to be alarmed, open. She enters her home and is invited to join Dewey, Gale, and Kincaid to watch a movie. As she goes to join the others, her front door blows open behind her, but she walks away, leaving it as is.

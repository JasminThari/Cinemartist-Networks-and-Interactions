Michael Luhser is a luckless misanthrope who lives alone in a squalid house in Olten. One day, Michael returns home from his dead-end office job, and is greeted by an angel, who claims that Michael has been chosen by Heaven to punish sinners in the name of God. While initially reluctant to believe the angel, Michael eventually goes out and murders a purse-snatching drug addict, and then a ruthless corporate raider named Gerhard Schmidt and Gerhard's wife, Daniela. After committing another double homicide, that of a dominatrix and her adulterous client, Michael becomes wracked with guilt, and leaves behind a message that reads, "Stop Me Please!" The angel alleviates Michael's doubts by having sex with him, and then has him gun down a greedy and unethical scientist named Doctor West.

While fleeing the scene of the crime, Michael is assaulted by a drunk, and aided by a woman named Sabine, who notices that Michael's bag is full of weapons, which causes her to realize that Michael is the so-called "Murderer of Olten." The angel has Michael drink her blood, and then orders him to kill Sabine. Michael slits Sabine's throat, and then goes out binge drinking before passing out at home, where he is awakened by the Police Commissioner. The Police Commissioner orders Michael to surrender, threatening to shoot him if he does not, but Michael instead shoots himself after sardonically declaring, "No, don't do it! Don't sin." Michael is sent to Hell, where the angel takes his form, and mockingly reveals to Michael that she is actually a demon, one who acted as a convenient "justification" for Michael's crimes, which the demon claims Michael committed simply because he wanted to, and not because he believed in God.

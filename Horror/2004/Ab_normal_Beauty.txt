Jiney, an art and photography student, wins an award for her work. Her male friend and co-student, Anson, congratulates her but she tells him that although she won an award, she is unhappy with the work. Her friend Jas, who she lives with, takes her from school on a 'date'. They go out to take photographs. 

Jiney's mother tells her that she is going away on business for a month. Later, she witnesses a fatal car accident and takes photographs of it. She finds herself obsessed with death and begins to take photographs of more explicit death subjects - chickens being killed, fish being scaled, dead birds and others. She talks about suicide, and there are flashbacks to an apparent incident from her youth when she was sexually abused by some young boys..

Vittorio, a Veronese goldsmith, meets Sonia through a blind date; the two begin to date and thereby to get to know each other, notwithstanding some initial doubts about the possibility of success of their relationship: Vittorio is having therapy due to his obsession with thin women up to the point of anorexia nervosa. Their relationship continues as Sonia agrees to lose weight — ignoring the man’s psychopathy — which she seemingly does as an act of love, not through her own desire.

What at first seems only a benign choice turns into a nightmare for Sonia, made worse because the two have chosen to live together. Vittorio becomes increasingly suspicious of Sonia, thinking (somewhat correctly) that she eats in secret. He therefore hides the food in her house such that she can only eat salad and vegetables.

Sonia becomes very thin, and begins to dislike herself. Her imprisonment becomes increasingly difficult and begins to be detrimental to her health. Due to the shared obsession with her weight, the two often find themselves in embarrassing situations in public. Furthermore, Vittorio’s business is getting worse and worse, ultimately leading to the closure of his laboratory.

One evening, Sonia has a crisis in a restaurant, due to her hunger. On returning home, Vittorio loses his temper and humiliates her, forcing her to be naked and throwing the food she had managed to hide into the fireplace. Having reached the limit, in order to free herself, Sonia commits an extreme gesture so, taking advantage of a moment of distraction from Vittorio, she grabs the fire iron and kills him by hitting him on the head.

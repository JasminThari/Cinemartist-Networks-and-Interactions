In 1831 a hamlet holds a yearly ritual to cleanse their home of anything they view as unclean. As a result, the deformed infant of a witch is thrown into a bonfire, which enrages her. She curses the town, saying that every Halloween a goblin will come to the town and try to take its children. Anyone attempting to stand in its way will be killed brutally.

Years later in modern day, Neil Perkins (Gil Bellows) travels to the hamlet (now called Hollowglen) with the intent of developing the town. With him are his wife Kate (Camille Sullivan), their two children, teenager Nikki (Tracy Spiridakos) and the infant Nathan, as well as Nikki's best friend. They're warned of the town's curse and that as they are arriving on Halloween eve, Nathan's life is in danger. The Perkins ignore the threat, only to find themselves in mortal danger.

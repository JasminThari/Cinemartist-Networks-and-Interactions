Researchers conduct secret and illegal experiments using stem cells. The researchers accidentally discover a serum derived from these stem cells capable of reviving dead cellular tissue. When a security guard, David Doyle, threatens to sue the research company and wants to leave the project, he is promptly murdered and used as a test subject.

David returns to life but, in the style of ''The Reanimator'', David is not the same man he once was. Not only is his personality and memory changed, but he is seen to have acquired psychic and telekinetic powers, as well as increased strength and aggression. David begins to act out against the researchers, who all at once are his captors, murderers, and creators.

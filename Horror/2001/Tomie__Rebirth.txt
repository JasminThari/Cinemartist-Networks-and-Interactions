An artist named Hideo is painting his girlfriend Tomie (Miki Sakai), but she dismisses it as a poor painting and he kills her in a jealous rage with an art knife. He gets his friends Shunsuke and Takumi to help him bury her. Later on, the three friends go to a party but see Tomie there; Hideo kills himself out of shock. Tomie latches onto Shunsuke only for his mother to kill her and they cut her up together in an unnatural ecstasy. They then burn her head, which has already started to regenerate and has some crude limbs for locomotion. Unbeknownst to them, they have not killed Tomie, as some of Tomie’s supernatural blood got on Hideo’s painting of her while he killed her, and the blood allows her to regenerate undetected. Takumi's girlfriend Hitomi gets possessed by another Tomie, in a rather viral fashion. The two Tomies become aware of each other and, in a jealous rage, the two Tomies try to eliminate the other.

Hitomi, however, is still awake despite being controlled mostly by Tomie. She doesn't want to become a monster, and so she decides to commit suicide. However, when at a waterfall, about to commit suicide, Tomie's head grows on the side of Hitomi's neck next to her head and forces her to stop. Takumi, meanwhile, gives his younger sister the portrait of Tomie, which still has some of her blood on it; after the two Tomies finally succeed in eliminating each other, as well as killing the others, Takumi's sister mourns for everyone lost and goes to the waterfall and throws flowers into it. A small facial mole can be seen directly beneath the sister's left eye, suggesting that, because Takumi gave her the portrait of Tomie, she was also possessed by her. Thus, the sister is the newest Tomie.

A group of college students head out to a cottage in the woods for a long weekend vacation. Not long after arriving, several of the teens wander off into the woods and disappear. More students arrive the next day. They find the mutilated remains of their friends buried in the snow. It seems someone in the woods is out to get them. The remaining teens try to escape, but one by one, the mysterious "figure" hunts them down. The Figure is a slasher-type character who is stalking the group of teens before they even arrive at the cottage. The Figure is a strong fighter and extremely resilient. He seems to be stronger than all of the teens. He also seems impossible to kill. Throughout the movie, he is shot, stabbed, beaten with a stick and hit by a truck but keeps coming back in perfect health. In addition, he is very resourceful. He sets up traps in the woods and uses guns, axes, knives, tools, chains and even wire hangers to butcher the teens. Once they arrive at the cottage, the Figure begins hunting down the teens in the most gruesome and brutal ways. For a short time, the teens suspect that one of them may be the Figure.

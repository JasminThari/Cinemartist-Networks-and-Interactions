Eight people are chosen to compete on ''Camp Slasher'', a new horror-themed game show in which the contestants must complete challenges while trying to avoid a masked killer, one who is based on a local urban legend. Unbeknownst to the cast and crew of the show, an actual homicidal maniac resides in the woods where they have decided to shoot, and after massacring the program's behind-the-scenes personnel, he sets his sights on the competitors.

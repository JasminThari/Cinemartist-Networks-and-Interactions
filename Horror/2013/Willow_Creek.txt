Set in Humboldt County, California, Jim (Bryce Johnson), a stout believer in Bigfoot, and his girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore), a skeptic, travel to Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California, where Jim plans to shoot his own Bigfoot footage at the site of the Patterson–Gimlin film.

The two stop at Willow Creek, the Bigfoot capital of the world, where Jim interviews various locals about Bigfoot. At a restaurant, they notice a missing woman on a poster on the wall. While heading into the forest in search of the Patterson–Gimlin filming location, they encounter a man who angrily tells them to leave, but Jim and Kelly ignore him. They set a camp in the middle of the woods and go for a swim. Upon their return, they find the camp trashed.
That evening, Jim proposes to Kelly, but feeling that it is too soon, decides they should move in together instead and they go to sleep.
	
That night they are awakened by mysterious sounds echoing through the woods, and whooping vocalizations. Cowering inside their tent, they can hear large creatures moving about outside, pushing into and investigating the tent, as well as the distant sound of a woman crying. The noises grow closer and something hits their tent. Scared, the couple decides to leave at dawn. In the morning as they try to return home, Jim discovers a clump of gray fur. They wander for hours in circles through the thick woods while hearing the same noises they heard the night before. During the night, Jim and Kelly encounter the woman from the missing person poster in Willow Creek, nude. An unseen creature attacks them, killing Jim and abducting Kelly, whose cries for help are heard in the distance. The movie ends with three whooping vocalizations.

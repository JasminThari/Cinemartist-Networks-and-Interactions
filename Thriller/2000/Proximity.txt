When William Conroy (Rob Lowe) a former college professor is sentenced to life in prison for vehicular manslaughter it seems his life is over. But, when a fellow inmate tells him that in the past two years fourteen inmates have died at the prison, and then turns up dead the next day, Conroy is in more danger than he ever imagined. His suspicions are confirmed when, while on the way to his parole hearing, the van carrying the inmates crashes. Seizing the opportunity, Conroy flees the scene and elicits the help of his lawyer (Mark Boone Junior). What the two discover is a grisly murder ring set up within the prison walls that incriminates those at the highest levels of the correctional system.

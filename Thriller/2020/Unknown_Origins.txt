One man is killed after being fed enough supplements and steroids to be the Hulk. Another has his heart plucked out and is covered in a metallic suit.

Attempting to stop this is Inspector David, a man who feels comics are for overgrown adults and quickly pays the price for that sort of criticism. Initially, he is assisted by Cosme, a cop spending his final days on the force after being forced to turn in his resignation. David's boss is the homicide chief (Norma), who loves cosplaying. In her words, she doesn't read comics, rather she watches movies and anime.

Joining the duo is Jorge Elías, Cosme's son. He is a comic geek and runs a comic book store in the city. When Cosme realizes the demented villain commits murders in the form of creating superhero origin stories, he feels Jorge is better suited to work the case with David.

Things escalate when David realizes his parents were killed the same way as Martha and Thomas Wayne were killed in the comics. Jorge, David, and Norma go up against a secret killer who is ahead of them the whole time. With time running out for the trio to find the killer, they face pressure as the news goes public. Bruguera, the forensic man in the department, is eventually revealed to be the killer and the rest of the story follows the trio attempting to put an end to his nefarious plans.

A world-weary cop comes to believe a recent murder of a middle-aged man is linked to a case of possible rape three decades earlier by a group of friends and a corrupt cop. Working through, he finds it linked to neurofibromatosis, a rare disease among Nordics. One thing leads to another and he puts the pieces together. A geneticist father loses his child to neurofibromatosis and his search for answers leads to his degenerate father and unravels many missing person cases during the decade.

Like the book on which it is based, the film is implicitly a semi-critique of the gene-gathering work of the Icelandic company deCODE genetics.<ref>Lucy Burke, "Genetics and the Scene of the Crime: DeCODING Tainted Blood", ''Journal of Literary & Cultural Disability Studies'', 6 (2012), 193â€“208. doi:10.3828/jlcds.2012.16.</ref>

A kidnapper disappeared 15 years ago without a trace. Five days before the case's statute of limitations expires, someone is found anonymously leaving a flower at the crime scene. A few days later, another kidnapping takes place using the same method on a similar target. Police team up to solve the case before it's too late as in its previous case. Detective (Kim Sang-kyung) is consulted and he confirms it is a similar MO.

Later it turns out to be the child's grandfather (Song Young-chang), was the perpetrator of the first kidnapping 15 years ago. This was found out by the mother (Uhm Jung-hwa), and she kidnaps his granddaughter using the same MO. She thought the guilt will make him confess his past crimes. The detectives find out, confront the grandfather, and make a deal with him. He confesses his sins and goes to prison. Everyone involved in the long-unsolved case finds closure.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=In Focus: Montage|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/inFocus.jsp?mode=VIEW&seq=41|work=Korean Film Council|accessdate=2013-04-27|date=30 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Montage (2013)|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/05/16/2013051601059.html|work=The Chosun Ilbo|accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref>

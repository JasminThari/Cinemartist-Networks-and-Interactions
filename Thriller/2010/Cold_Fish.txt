Nobuyuki Shamoto is the quiet and unambitious owner of a Shizuoka shop specializing in selling tropical fish. His home life leaves much to be desired, as his daughter Mitsuko is rebellious and physically abuses her stepmother Taeko, his second wife. One night Nobuyuki is summoned when Mitsuko is caught shoplifting at a local supermarket. Yukio Murata, a patron at the supermarket, persuades the manager to drop the matter and invites Nobuyuki to visit his own, larger tropical fish shop. During an impromptu tour of Yukio's shop, Nobuyuki meets his wife, Aiko. Stating that fate brought the two men together, the gregarious Yukio convinces Nobuyuki to go into business with him. Yukio also takes on Mitsuko as a worker in his shop.

The film is loosely based on the exploits of two Tokyo serial killers, Sekine Gen and Hiroko Kazama, a husband and wife duo who owned a pet shop and murdered at least four people.<ref name="Twitch">{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/interviews/2011/01/screenwriter-yoshiki-takahashi-talks-cold-fish.php|work=Twitch|title= Screenwriter Yoshiki Takahashi Talks COLD FISH|first=Todd|last=Brown|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225052110/http://twitchfilm.com/interviews/2011/01/screenwriter-yoshiki-takahashi-talks-cold-fish.php|archivedate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>

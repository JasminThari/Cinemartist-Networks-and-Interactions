On the evening of November 7, photographer Sophie Jacobs and her attorney boyfriend Hugh go to dinner at a Chinese restaurant. As they travel home afterward, Sophie develops a craving for "something sweet" and stops their car at a convenience store. While Hugh is in the store buying some chocolate for Sophie, an armed man arrives and holds up the store, shooting the store clerk, his son, and Hugh dead. He runs away as Sophie arrives.

Sophie sinks into a deep depression, and cannot bring herself to erase Hugh's voice from their apartment's answering machine. She consults her psychiatrist, Dr. Fayn, about persistent headaches that she has been suffering from since his death. She tells Dr. Fayn that the headaches started to occur before the incident at the convenience store, and that she had been having an affair with a co-worker, Jesse. After Hugh's death Sophie has dinner with her mother, Carol Jacobs, who accidentally knocks a glass over.

During a college photography class that she teaches, Sophie sets up a slide projector for the students to showcase their best photographs. One slide in the slide show depicts the exterior of the convenience store on the evening of November 7. Sophie contacts Officer Roberts, the head of the investigation into the shootings at the convenience store, who is as puzzled as she is as to who is responsible for the photos. Sophie's headaches continue, and she begins to hear strange noises coming from within her apartment building and mysterious voices on the phone. Later, Officer Roberts discovers that the photo of the convenience store was paid for with Sophie's credit card.

The film presents two more different versions of these events, and Sophie must figure out which is real before she loses grip on her sanity, and her life. The second version suggests that Sophie was present at the shootings and was only spared because the shooter ran out of bullets, and the third suggests both Sophie and Hugh were killed. In the words of Cox, her character "goes through three phases. First there's denial. Then she feels guilty and sad about the situation. Then she has to learn to accept it."<ref name="NYDailyNews-Jul2005">{{cite news|last=Mills |first=Nancy |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/329582p-281679c.html |date=July 20, 2005 |title=Dramatic turn for Courteney |work=New York Daily News |access-date=September 19, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525063341/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/329582p-281679c.html |archive-date=2006-05-25}}</ref> According to Greg Harrison, the events in the film were Sophie's memories as she and Hugh lay dying on the floor of the convenience store: "Each movement of this memory was her process of coming to terms with the terrible trauma, which was that she was killed for absolutely no reason, and it was some random act of violence she couldnâ€™t confront". He added he felt ''November'' was "open-ended" enough that he hoped viewers would "come up with the most beautiful stories themselves that are very different from how I saw it."<ref name="TCM">{{cite web |last=Mapes |first=Marty |date=August 22, 2005 |title=November |url=http://www.moviehabit.com/essays/harrison05.shtml |access-date=June 27, 2006 |website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref>

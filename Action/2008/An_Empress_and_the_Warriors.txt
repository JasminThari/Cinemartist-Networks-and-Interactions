The film is set in ancient China, probably during the period of the sixteen kingdoms when China was divided into a number of rival kingdoms. The state of Yan, founded by the Murong tribe of the Xianbei nation, has long been a target of attacks by the Zhao army. Princess Fei'er of Yan becomes the new ruler after her father, the Emperor, is killed in battle, with general Murong Xuehu assisting her in defending their kingdom from invasion.

Prince Yan Huba, nephew of the deceased king and a treacherous minister in Yan, schemes to take the throne from his cousin and he sends his men to assassinate the princess. Fei'er survives the attempt on her life but is seriously injured. She is rescued later by a mysterious hermit named Duan Lanquan and lives with him for a period of time until she recovers. The two of them develop romantic feelings for each other during that period of time. However, she ultimately must decide whether to fulfill her duty to her kingdom or follow her heart.<ref name="yesasia">{{cite web|url=http://www.yesasia.com/us/an-empress-and-the-warriors-2008-dvd-taiwan-version/1014063426-0-0-0-en/info.html|title=An Empress and the Warriors (2008) (DVD) (Taiwan Version) |publisher=yesasia.com|accessdate=2009-03-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307134257/http://www.yesasia.com/us/an-empress-and-the-warriors-2008-dvd-taiwan-version/1014063426-0-0-0-en/info.html| archivedate= 7 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

However, Huba is still plotting to take the throne and he leads his men to kill Duan Lanquan and Murong Xuehu. On the verge of danger, Empress Fei'er manages to kill Huba personally and put an end to Huba's evil plans, all while restoring peace and harmony by maintaining good relations with the other ten realms.

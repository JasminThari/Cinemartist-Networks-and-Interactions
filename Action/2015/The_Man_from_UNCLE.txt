In 1963 CIA-Agent Napoleon Solo extracts Gaby Teller, daughter of nuclear scientist Dr. Udo Teller. Solo and KGB Agent Illya Kuryakin are ordered to team up and stop Alexander and Victoria Vinciguerra, Nazi sympathizers using Teller to build their own private nuclear weapon.

The men travel to Rome with Gaby, whose uncle Rudi works for the Vinciguerras. Muggers take Kuryakin's father's watch, but Kuryakin does not react in order to maintain his cover. Solo and Kuryakin break into a Vinciguerra shipping yard and find traces of uranium. While escaping into the water Kuryakin nearly drowns, but Solo saves him.

The following day, Gaby meets with Rudi and Alexander and betrays Kuryakin and Solo to them. Rudi tortures Solo, but Kuryakin rescues him and tortures Rudi. Rudi reveals the weapon is hidden in an island fortress where Gaby has been reunited with her father. Teller completes the weapon, and Victoria kills him.

Solo and Kuryakin are approached by Alexander Waverly, a MI6 officer who reveals Gaby is his undercover officer. They infiltrate the Vinciguerras' compound. Solo finds Kuryakin's stolen watch on a guard. Alexander attempts to escape with the warhead, but is intercepted and killed. Solo retrieves the disc with Teller's research but realizes Alexander's warhead was a decoyâ€”Victoria has left with the real warhead. Solo distracts Victoria via radio while Waverly launches a homing missile, destroying the nuclear weapon and killing Victoria.

Kuryakin confronts Solo in his hotel room, and Solo returns the stolen watch. Kuryakin admits his assignment was to kill Solo and take the disc for his government. Solo replies that he knew this, and had the same orders. They instead burn the contents of the disc, to give neither side the upper hand in the arms race. Reuniting with Gaby and Waverly, the trio have been reassigned to Waverly's international organization. Waverly gives them a new mission under a new codename: U.N.C.L.E.

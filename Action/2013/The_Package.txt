The film starts with Tommy Wicker (Steve Austin), arriving at a bowling alley and beating up a rival for not paying back Big Doug. Afterwards he visits Big Doug who tells him he wants a package delivered to "The German" (Dolph Lundgren), a dangerous crime lord. En route he is pursued by a rival gang who kills his partner and wants what he is carrying, forcing him to fight them off and run.

Eventually Tommy is captured by the rival gang and delivered to Anthony. He kills Anthony and most of the gang, manages to escape, is captured by the German and brought to see if he has compatible DNA with the German. He then breaks free and has a final showdown with the German, killing him. He then wishes Big Doug that the incident be filed away and they wish each other a hearty godspeed. Tommy then calls his wife Darla about the cash and tells her "I love you."

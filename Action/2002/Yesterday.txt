Yun Suk, an experienced agent from the Special Investigations Unit (SI or SIU) tries to locate and take down a serial killer, who is known only by the alias "Goliath" (taken from the Bible). His investigation, however, becomes a bit personal after Goliath instigates an incident that results in the death of his son, Hanbyul.

After Kim Hisu, the daughter of the Korean National Police Agency commissioner gets kidnapped by armed terrorists during a raid, the two work together to investigate Goliath's motives, which has something to do with a secret project formerly funded by the South Korean Defense Ministry.

Enteng is a gym assistant who lives with his mother, Belen, sister Mara and brother, and has a crush on a local schoolteacher named Cielo. One day he encounters a disused barbell that gives him superhuman abilities as Captain Barbell, who later talks to him about his responsibilities and the source of his powers, a meteor which disintegrated into several pieces and has also granted powers to others who used it for evil. 

The first of them is Utoy, a vagrant who is lynched and dumped next to a meteorite fragment next to a pile of rats who transforms into a mutant called Dagampatay. Wandering around, he dissolves people with his spit and summons rats around him. After an attempt to poison the La Mesa Reservoir, he is defeated by Captain Barbell when he boomerangs his spit back into himself, dissolving him. The second villain is Roselle, a rape victim who was dumped near blocks of ice and gain freezing powers hence the name Freezy. She kills her rapist and goes on a killing spree of men she seduces before being frozen by Captain Barbell when he shields himself using her hands. 

The main villain is Lagablab, formerly Enteng's father Arnaldo, a fire-breather at a circus who went on the run after killing his employer and getting struck by lightning, gaining pyrokinetic abilities. He is defeated by Captain Barbell when he sends him to outer space.

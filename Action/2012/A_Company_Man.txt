Ji Hyeong-do works for a metal fabrication company which is a front for their assassination trade. Hyeong-Do is one of the most skilled assassins. One day, Hyeong-do is assigned to get rid of his young partner Ra-Hun, after finishing their assigned hit. Ra Hun asks Hyeong-Do to give money to his family as a favor. 

Hyeong-do visits Ra Hun's home, where he meets Ra Hun's mother Yu Mi-Yeon, a former singer, and falls in love with her. When Hyeong-do's colleague wants to quit his job at the company as his job has become meaningless to him after his son's death. Hyeong-do is assigned the task of finishing him, but finds himself in a life crisis as well and his bonding with Mi-Yeon is increasing day by day.

The company's boss thinks very highly of him, even though his direct superior, Kwon has a problem with him. Eventually, Hyeong-Do's crisis makes him end up in a situation in which he becomes disloyal to the company and suddenly finds himself to become the target of his former employees. 

Learning this, Hyeong-go and Mi-Yeon leave for a safe place to start a new life, but Kwon and his colleagues catch up to him and kill Mi-Yeon in front of him and shoots Hyeong-Do, who survives and leaves for his office where he intends to finish them and a shootout ensues, in which Hyeong-Do finishes the assassins and Kwon. Later, the police surround the building, and Hyeong-Do surrenders to the police.

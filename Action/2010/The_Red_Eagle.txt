In the year 2013 in Bangkok, the Liberal Party leader Direk Damrongprapa (Pornwut Sarasin) campaigns during an election on an anti-corruption platform with the support of his fiancée Vasana Tienpradap (Yarinda Bunnag), a Harvard University educated geology expert. Three years later Vasana separates herself from Direk who has become the prime minister over his betrayal in refusing to stop construction of the Chumporn nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, a masked vigilante known as Red Eagle (Ananda Everingham) emerges within the city. Red Eagle is actually Rom Rittikrai, a former Thai Special Force agent who had been rescued by Vasana when escaping from an attack by the Matulee (a secret society that hires masked assassin Black Devil to murder Red Eagle) and got a bullet in the brain; his terrible headaches can only be relieved by regular dose of morphine. Red Eagles has dispatched drug-dealers while a CSD Agent former Royal Thai Special Force Detective Chart Wuttikrai (Wannasingh Prasertkul) and his Sikh colleague Singh (Jonathan Hallman) are ordered to track down Red Eagle. Red Eagle kills the parliamentary member Sonkuan who is a child pornographer. This leads him to become the no. 1 target of the Matulee. Vasana recognises that Red Eagle and Rome are the same man, igniting an attraction between them. Meanwhile, Chart and the Matalee continue to hunt Red Eagle down.<ref name="fba-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/the-red-eagle|work=Film Business Asia|title=The Red Eagle (อินทรีแดง)|author=Elley, Derek|accessdate=October 29, 2010|date=October 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125001352/http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/the-red-eagle|archivedate=January 25, 2011}}</ref>

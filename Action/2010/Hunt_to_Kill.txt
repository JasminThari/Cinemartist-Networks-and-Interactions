The film begins with border patrol agent Jim Rhodes and his partner Lee exploring a seemingly abandoned trailer in Texas. Prior to entering the trailer Lee gives Jim a watch made from climbing rope that can be used as emergency gear. They find a meth lab and are promptly attacked by men who shoot Lee and set the trailer on fire. Lee dies and Jim is forced to flee the trailer before it explodes. 

Some time later, a group of men have stolen millions of dollars in bearer bonds from the Hotel Palacio casino in Reno. They regroup in a warehouse where the bonds are stolen by one of the group, Lawson. The other thieves, led by Lawson's right-hand man Banks, manage to track Lawson to Lowery, Montana, where Jim now lives with his rebellious daughter Kim. He's called in to pick her up from the Sherriff's office after she was caught shoplifting, only to discover Banks beating and killing the Sherriff. They force Jim to help them traverse the wilderness and find Lawson, threatening to kill Kim if he refuses. He agrees and the group sets out into the mountains. The thieves manage to catch up to Lawson, who they kill after taking back the money. Assuming that Kim can serve as their guide, they push Jim off a cliff. 

Now angrier than before, Jim survives and hunts the thieves, picking them off one by one until only Banks is left. Banks flees to an outpost manned by three Canadian cops. He murders the cops and flees in one of their ATVs, leaving Kim behind. Jim arrives on the scene and takes one of the remaining ATVs to chase after Banks, telling Kim to use the other to get help. He catches up to Banks in an abandoned factory and the two men battle, culminating in Jim killing Banks by pinning him to a wall with an ATV and causing an explosion with a flare gun. The film ends with Jim and Kim safe, but realizing that they must now walk home as the other ATVs were destroyed.

Years after his defeat by George "Iceman" Chambers, Yuri Boyka, now a prison janitor, hears about the Prison Spetz Competition (PSC), an inter-prison tournament offering a chance at early release. Boyka trains privately to recover from his knee injury and challenges the current PSC champion, Vladimir Sykov, defeating him and becoming the Russian representative.

At Gorgon prison in Georgia, Boyka joins a group of international fighters. They face harsh conditions while Colombian fighter Raul "Dolor" Qui√±ones receives special treatment and drugs. Boyka clashes with American fighter Jericho "Turbo" Jones, but they eventually develop trust and train together. Boyka learns that the tournament is fixed for-profit and confronts the organizers with the help of mob bosses Gaga and Gio Farnatti. Boyka and Turbo advance in the tournament along with Dolor and Brazilian fighter Rodrigo Silva.

Turbo and Boyka are thrown into solitary confinement after a fight but are released due to their managers' influence. Boyka realizes the managers only care about their profit and plans to defeat Dolor. During the semi-finals, Boyka wins against Silva and offers him respect. The organizers arrange for Turbo to be beaten by guards, pushing Boyka to plan an escape. They fight the guards, escape, and Boyka returns to face Dolor alone.

Dolor takes the lead, exploiting Boyka's weak knee. However, Boyka adapts by using a blood-soaked pad as a brace and employs a new fighting style. He defeats Dolor, ruining the managers' bets. Farnatti kills Rezo but is shot by the warden. Boyka is not freed due to Turbo's escape, but Turbo rescues him from execution. They meet Gaga, who reveals he bet on Boyka all along. Boyka and Turbo part ways, vowing to have a future match. Boyka walks towards freedom with the money, while Turbo reveals his real name as Jericho. They part on good terms, and Boyka laughs joyfully.

While on an unsanctioned covert mission in Africa, a small team of Navy SEALs uncovers intelligence pointing to the imminent sale of a massive quantity of weapons grade uranium. Now, with no mission prep and zero support, they have less than 36 hours to fight their way past a ruthless warlord's army guarding this secret mining operation, hidden deep in the treacherous Congo, in order to secure the yellowcake and expose the unknown buyer. As the story moves along, the asset that the SEAL team was asked to secure, turns out to be the warlord. With three of the team members lost and one taken by the adversaries, Case fights his way into their nest to save his teammate and give the enemy a withering end.

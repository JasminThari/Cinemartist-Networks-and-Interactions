Three years later, Fung Yu-Sau is a martial artist who challenges retired martial arts master Mak Wing-Yan in a fight and soon kills him. Hahou learns about Wing-Yan's death and tells Inspector Luk Yuen-Sum that he offers to aid her in capturing the killer with his martial arts skills in exchange for his freedom. After agreeing his terms, Luk temporarily releases Hahou.

Hahou and Luk deduces that another two masters Tam King-yiu and Wong-Chit will killed by Yu-Sau, which is proven correct. After reuniting with his wife Sinn Ying, Hahou, along with Luk soon learns about Yu-sau's identity. They also finds that Yu-Sau is actually obsessed of defeating great martial artists in order to become a martial arts master and also forget his wife's death. Thinking that Yu-sau's next target is Chan Pak-Kwong, Hahou, Luk and his team spies on Pak-Kwong at his restaurant, but later finds that Yu-sau's target is actually Pak-Kwong's student and actor Hung Yip. 

Hahou, Sinn, Luk and his team learns about Yu-sau's location and waits for him to arrive. It is revealed that Yu-sau's target is actually Sinn where Hahou prevents him from killing Sinn. Yu-sau escapes again, but Hahou tracks him at the highway and the two intensively battle each other. After the fight, Yu-sau gets shot by Luk while Hahou is taken to the hospital. In the aftermath, Hahou gets permanently released from prison, where he is later appointed again as the police self-defense instructor and also forms his own martial arts school.

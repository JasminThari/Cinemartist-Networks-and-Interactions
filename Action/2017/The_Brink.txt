Sai Gau is a reckless police officer who is dead set on tracking down Shing, a smuggler of black market gold disguising under the guise of commercial fishing business. When he learns that Shing is going after a triad boss's underwater gold vault, Sai Gau takes to the high seas to hunt for his prey.

Shing, a orphan adopted by the mob boss of the gold smuggling operation, Guo is entrusted by his adoptive father to look over his inexperienced and brash son and heir Shawn Yuen when his health is deteriorated. However, Shawn Yuen dislikes being told what to do by Shing and plans to kill Shing so he can succeed his father wholly.

News has spread that triad leader Jimmy Yam (Tony Leung Ka-fai) will be assassinated within 24 hours. Yam, who has an exaggerated personality, he would like to use this opportunity to expand his power and influence and sees the true side of people around him, including his wife Sophie (Sandra Ng), counselor Wai (Chan Fai-hung), bodyguard Yue (Roy Cheung), rival Luk See (Robert Siu), triad newcomer Tiger (Samuel Pang), and his sworn brother Jeff (Eric Tsang), a voluntary scapegoat who served in person for Yam, all of whom which have another side which Yam had never known.

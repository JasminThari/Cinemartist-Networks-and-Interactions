Junie (Navarro), is an ice cream vendor, who sells ice cream to children and adults alike. After his shift, he is in a predicament with a rival vendor, Dodoy (Jay Manalo). Their manager, angered by their actions, demotes Junie to a warehouse guard. Dodoy celebrates, only to be demoted too, working a different shift to Junie. Junie goes home in a bad mood, until he sees the love of his life, Liana (Aubrey Miles). After dinner, Junie is ready to sleep, to start a new job the next day. While working, Junie accidentally swallows a spider which has been exposed to a chemical spill, thus giving him web slinging abilities, and becoming "Gagamboy"(Spiderboy).<ref>{{cite web |title=Gagamboy |url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/g/gagmboy.htm |website=International Catalogue of Superheroes |access-date=March 7, 2021}}</ref> After his shift, Dodoy comes in to work and leaves a sandwich unprotected. A cockroach exposed to the same spill as the spider slips into his sandwich, and as he eats it, he collapses, only to regain consciousness as a large cockroach. He hires two henchmen, and calls himself "Ipisman" (Cockroachman). Junie and Dodoy both try to win Liana's love. Dodoy practically gives up, only to return as Cockroachman, to kidnap Liana to lure Spiderboy to his lair. There, he plans to finish off Spiderboy, but the tables turn and Dodoy is destroyed.

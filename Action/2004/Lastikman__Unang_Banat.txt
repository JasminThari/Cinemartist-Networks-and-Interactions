Adrian, is an ordinary boy who lacks skills and talents. He likes his friend Lara, but is often bullied by his classmates and kids in the neighborhood. Despite being a weakling, Adrian possesses a pure and brave heart when he tries to fight illegal loggers who try and cut an enchanted rubber tree. Unfortunately, he is beaten by the loggers and left almost half dead. But because of his pure personality, the enchanted rubber tree that he saves heals him and grants him powers that transform him into a super hero named Lastikman who can stretch his body at incredible distance and transform into different objects. After a series of exploits, he, his family and Lara move to Manila. On the other hand, the tree also gives powers to Editha, a single mother who lost her children in a witch-hunt after being falsely accused of being an aswang, granting her the same powers as Lastikman, as well as shapeshifting powers and carnivorous tentacles that grow on her back. Assuming the identity Lastika, she takes revenge on her tormentors and moves to Manila, where she unsuccessfully tries to entice Lastikman to join her in her bid for world domination after saving him from a Werewolf. After more exploits, Lastikman confronts Lastika for a final time when she shapeshifts into him while committing a series of crimes. Lastika initially has the upper hand, but is killed when Lastikman pulls down a live wire on a puddle of gasoline that Lastika is standing over, incinerating her. Lara realizes that Lastikman and Adrian are the same person and the movie ends with them becoming a couple.

Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is the commander of an elite U.S. military unit. During an overseas assignment in Paris, Lawson loses all three of his men in a seemingly random attack on their hotel room. He takes it upon himself to investigate the attack, with the help of his girlfriend Tia (Lisa Lovbrand) and his friend Dwayne (David Kennedy). Marshall uncovers CTX, a covert military drug so secret that an arm of the military headed by a man named Werner (Danny Webb) wants Marshall eliminated. Tia turns out to be one of the two military scientists who developed CTX.

Reina (Evelyne Armela O'Bami), the prostitute who slaughtered Marshall's team, was under the influence of CTX. The drug gives its users superhuman strength and agility, but also irrevocably drives them to violence. The other co-inventor of CTX is Aroon (Adam Croasdell), now a Paris night club owner. Aroon has plans to release the CTX into the Paris' water supply, which would turn the city's residents into deranged killers. Marshall, Tia, and Dwayne must stop Aroon and Werner before that happens.

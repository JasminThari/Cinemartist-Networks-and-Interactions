In the present,{{refn|group=N|Set after ''Superman: Man of Tomorrow''.}} Barry Allen and Iris West picnic in Metropolis, hoping to get away from "work". However, their plans are disrupted by Superman fighting Brainiac. Allen comes to Superman's aid as the Flash. When Brainiac fires a Kryptonite bullet, Flash tries to catch it, but runs fast enough to channel the Speed Force for the first time. Guided by someone's voice, Allen arrives in what he believes is the past during a battle between the JSA and the Nazis. Despite initial confusion over his allegiance, the JSA realizes Allen is an ally and seemingly comes from the future. As the team mobilizes to stop another wave of Nazis, Allen takes Trevor back to the JSA's base and learns about the team, whom he never heard of before.

The JSA's next mission involves saving a codebreaker from a Nazi fortress. He can presumably decode a message Trevor stole. Despite the risk of causing a time paradox, the heroes realize they need Allen's help.

The heroes and "Shakespeare", the JSA's war correspondent, break in the fortress, defeat the guards, and discover prisoners in the dungeons. A guard attacks Shakespeare, only for the bullets to bounce off of him. Shakespeare's actual name turns out to be Clark Kent. However, he has a different background from the Kent Allen knows. Because of this, Allen realizes that he is in a parallel reality. Meanwhile, the JSA finds the codebreaker, whom Hawkman recognizes as Doctor Fate. Allen recognizes Fate as the man who called out to him. He asks Fate if it is possible for him to return. According to Fate, Barry can return but there is a lesson he needs to learn first and a mission he has to accomplish. Breaking the code with his powers, Fate directs the team to the Bermuda Triangle before disappearing.

Arriving at the Triangle by sub, the team is detected by Nazi warships. After depth charges disable the engines, the Flashes jump-start the sub while Wonder Woman attacks the enemy ships. The heroes are saved by Atlantean soldiers, who direct them to a nearby outpost. There, the JSA meets Aquaman, who imprisons them. The code turns out to be a trap and Aquaman is being controlled by the Advisor, a telepathic mercenary who is influencing the Atlanteans to work with the Nazis. The Advisor hopes to destroy them later and take over the planet. The Flashes join forces to break out. The team splits up, with one heading for New York to stop the Nazis and Atlanteans while Allen and Wonder Woman try to stop Aquaman and the Advisor from releasing sea monsters from the Trench.

While attacking Manhattan, the Atlantean forces are confronted by the JSA. The heroes gain the upper hand until the monsters arrive, killing Hawkman and wounding Hourman. Garrick and Canary destroy the monsters while Wonder Woman and Allen fight Aquaman. With the help of Trevor, Wonder Woman breaks Aquaman's trident and frees him from the Advisor's control. Realizing what he has done, Aquaman retreats in guilt. The Advisor then reveals that a follow-up strike by Nazi bombers is imminent before killing Trevor with Aquaman's broken weapon. Barry knocks out the Advisor while Kent returns to destroy the bombers. Before dying, Trevor proposes to Wonder Woman, and she accepts. The Advisor regains consciousness and escapes. The JSA vows to avenge Trevor.

Before returning to his Earth, Allen says goodbye to the JSA. Wonder Woman gives him the ring Trevor gave her, warning him of holding off for tomorrow. Allen and Garrick use their combined speed to send the former back to the moment he intercepted the bullet. After destroying Brainiac with it, Allen suggests forming a superhero team{{refn|group=N|Identified off-screen as the Justice League who make an appearance in ''Green Lantern: Beware My Power''.}} to combat future threats. He then returns to Iris and proposes to her. She accepts.

During the 1st century BC, Roman general Mark Antony gives Egyptian queen Cleopatra three bejeweled eggs as a wedding gift. The eggs are lost in time until two are found by a farmer in 1907, but the last one remains lost for over 2,000 years.

In the present, John Hartley is an FBI agent who investigates the theft of one of the eggs on display at the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, along with Interpol agent Urvashi Das. Wanted international art thief Nolan Booth escapes with the egg but finds Hartley and the Interpol at his home in Bali. They arrest Booth but Booth's main competition Sarah "The Bishop" Black, steals the egg. Das has Hartley incarcerated in a remote Russian prison with Booth, believing he is responsible for the theft. Hartley suggests that he and Booth work together to defeat Black; if he helps Hartley imprison her, Booth will be the number one art thief in the world and Hartley's name will be cleared. The pair escapes from prison and heads for Valencia to steal the second egg. 

The second egg is in the possession of arms dealer Sotto Voce. They infiltrate his masquerade ball and fight Black in Voce's vault for the egg.  Black reveals she is working with Voce and they torture Hartley until Booth reveals the location of the third egg. Black betrays Voce and leaves for Egypt, where Booth claims it is. Booth reveals to Hartley that he lied; the egg is actually in Argentina in a secret location inscribed on his late father's special watch, which once belonged to Adolf Hitler's personal art curator Rudolph Zeich. Searching the jungle, they find a secret bunker containing Nazi artifacts, including the third egg. Black arrives to steal it but the three are interrupted by Das and police. Hartley, Booth and Black escape in an antique 1931 Mercedes-Benz 770. 

Booth learns that Hartley is actually not an FBI profiler, but a conman, and shares the Bishop mantle with Black; Hartley and Black are a couple and work as a team. They had planned the entire heist from the very beginning, using Booth to take them to the third egg. Booth surrenders and they leave him handcuffed. In Cairo, Hartley and Black deliver the three eggs to an Egyptian billionaire as a gift for his daughter's wedding. They then double-cross him; Interpol raids the wedding and arrests the billionaire. Six months later, Hartley and Black find Booth on their boat in Sardinia. He informs them that he told Das about their Cayman Islands account containing the $300 million payout for the eggs, which Das freezes, leaving them with no money, in retaliation for leaving him cuffed. He also reveals that Interpol is on their way to capture them, and offers escape if they help him with a new heist, which requires three individuals to pull off. They agree and Das places red notices on all of them. The trio begin their heist at the Louvre in Paris.

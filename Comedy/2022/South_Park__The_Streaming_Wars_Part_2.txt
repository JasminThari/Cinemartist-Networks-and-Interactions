Amidst the streaming wars, the drought in South Park has significantly worsened. In court, Eric Cartman sues his mother Liane, forcing Stan Marsh, Tolkien Black, Butters Stotch and Kyle Broflovski to testify about how Cartman used the money they earned to pay for his breast implants; the case is ultimately dismissed. Elsewhere, Randy Marsh wakes up on a bench, surrounded by fearful onlookers. Police tranquilize Randy and transport him to the hospital, where Detective Harris explains that Randy went "full nuclear Karen". Meanwhile, Tolkien searches the late Robert Cussler's abandoned home for clues about his missing father, Steve. When he tells Cartman of Cussler's death, Cartman surmises that Tolkien is having sex with Liane, believing it to be why she is standing up to Cartman.

At a Denver city council meeting, Pi Pi proposes his pitch deck to have his water park, and subsequently the entirety of Colorado, run entirely on urine. His service is endorsed by celebrities who promoted cryptocurrency and NFTs. Meanwhile, a remorseful Randy abandons his marijuana farming business and resumes his geology profession, searching for a solution to the drought. As Denver is about to commission Pi Pi's service, Randy arrives and proposes building a desalination plant, which Denver accepts. Enraged, Pi Pi orders his staff, including ManBearPig, to get rid of Randy. Cartman and Butters spy on Tolkien at his house; when Tolkien confronts them, Cartman reveals his research on the drought. Cartman, Butters and Tolkien tell Harris of their research; Harris, believing that Steve is behind the drought, reveals that ManBearPig is likely being exploited as it fears for its mate, PigBearGirl; and their offspring, Chuck Chuck. When Harris reveals a photo of Steve at the water park, the boys realize he must be there. Steve regains consciousness in a sewer; noticing his patched-up wound, he realizes that PigBearGirl and Chuck Chuck tended to him.

Construction of the desalination plant begins as Randy realizes that there will be an issue transporting saltwater uphill to the plant. As Cartman, Butters and Tolkien survey the waterpark, they locate an employee entrance near the water slide seen in Harris' photo. Inside, they discover Chuck Chuck before being trapped by security. Pi Pi tells the boys his plans to have everyone invest in his urine service and eliminate the boys. Harris visits Linda Black at Credigree Weed, revealing his intent to kill Steve if he finds him, while Steve eavesdrops on their conversation. Randy receives a call from his coworkers that ManBearPig, referred to as "climate change," has destroyed the plant, presumably in search of Randy. Steve finds Randy and tells him of Pi Pi's plan. Randy's family convinces him to revert to his Karen persona, using a strain of marijuana Sharon had saved.

As Pi Pi films his latest commercial, Randy, as Karen, forces his way into the waterpark and reveals Pi Pi's plan to everyone present. The distraction allows the kids to escape with the help of Chuck Chuck and PigBearGirl. Tolkien and ManBearPig are reunited with their respective families. Now free from Pi Pi's control, ManBearPig decapitates him. Randy convinces Cartman and other women with breast implants to drain their saline implants and power the desalination plant. The plant restores water to the Denver area as ManBearPig and his family return to the woods. When Linda suggests that Chuck Chuck should be killed before he ends up like his father, Stan instead suggests that the people reach out to him, but Randy dismisses this, inviting everyone to simply smoke some marijuana.

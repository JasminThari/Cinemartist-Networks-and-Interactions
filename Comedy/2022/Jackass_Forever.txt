{{Anchor|Plot}}
''Jackass Forever'' is a compilation of stunts, skits and pranks intercut with on-set talking heads with its cast. The film begins with a tribute to ''kaiju'' cinema, in what appears to be a city being overrun by a giant green monster. In reality, it is Chris Pontius' penis painted green over a small set of a city, intercut with the cast members running through a life-size set of the same city. The intro ends with the "monster" bitten by a snapping turtle and Johnny Knoxville's intro, "Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville! Welcome to ''Jackass''!"

Stunts and pranks with the main cast include Knoxville facing a bull resulting in dangerous consequences; Dave England unsuspectingly getting pig semen dumped on him during a fake interview about the movie; Steve-O having his penis used as a beehive; Ehren McGhehey being subjected to painful tests with an athletic cup; Pontius' penis being used as the paddle for paddle ball; a vulture eating pieces of meat off Wee Man's body; and Preston Lacy's testicles being used as a miniature punching bag. The newcomers are also featured in many of the stunts and pranks, including Poopies trying to kiss a Texas rat snake; Jasper Dolphin being shot off a ramp by large industrial fans while he's holding a parachute; Zach Holmes gliding down into a bed of cactuses; Eric Manaka riding a bicycle full speed into a false wall; and Rachel Wolfson having a scorpion sting her lips.

The final stunt, Vomitron, features Zach, Dave, Eric, Poopies, Steve-O and Jasper drinking milk while strapped to a high-speed carousel. As they start vomiting, Knoxville and the rest of the cast initiate an attack involving paintball guns, a tennis machine and multiple explosions. After assuring the stunt is over, one big explosion is set off, surprising the victims of the stunt.

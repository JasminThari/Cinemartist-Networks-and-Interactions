Ray Pluto is a New York City police detective who failed to stop a shooting spree at a burger joint because his back gave out and he fell. The suspect ended up being shot by a bystander, a young boy. The incident has made Ray a laughingstock in the city. He's also haunted by memories of his wife and child dying in a traffic accident. While Ray is put on limited duty until he is declared medically fit, he retreats to his couch to smoke marijuana, but is persuaded to seek treatment for his back by seeing Dr. Ann Beamer, a chiropractor. A romance blossoms between the two. Meanwhile, Pluto's partner, Detective Jerry Cubbins, has decided to come out of the closet. 

A variety of tenants live in Ray's West Side apartment building, including Cletis and Duke, two young men who want to write a Quentin Tarantino-esque movie script, and rebellious teenager Maribel who hires thugs to kill her father Juan, who is also the super of the building. Ray discovers the plot on Juan and must get past his grief to prevent the murder.

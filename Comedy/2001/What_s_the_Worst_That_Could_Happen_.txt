Kevin reveals his criminal activities to Amber, shocking her at first, but she accepts it in order to be with him. She eventually gives Kevin her father's lucky ring.

Meanwhile, Max Fairbanks, a wealthy businessman facing bankruptcy, seeks legal advice from his lawyer, Walter Greenbaum. Max, known for his extravagant spending, disregards the seriousness of the situation. He keeps spending and suggests declaring bankruptcy immediately to protect his assets. Max tells his wife, Lutetia, that his company is going through a technical procedure to hide the truth.

Through a friend named Berger, Kevin learns about Max's financial troubles. Berger informs him about Max's beachfront mansion, which Kevin sees as an opportunity. They plan to rob Max's house but end up getting caught. Max recognizes Amber's stolen ring and forces Kevin to hand it over to the police. Kevin escapes and returns to the house later, seeking revenge. He robs Max's valuables and one of his cars, telling Amber that the ring was stolen from him.

Walter informs Max that he is banned from his summer house due to breaching the bankruptcy terms. Max remains confident, believing the ring brings him luck. Kevin and Berger hire a hacker named Shelly Nix to track Max's whereabouts by hacking into his email. During a flight, Max consults his psychic associate, Gloria, about the ring. Gloria draws a disturbing card but keeps it a secret.

Max insults a judge he believed he bribed to save his house, leading to an order for its public auction. As the crooks continue to rob Max's properties, Max meets with Detective Alex Tardio and contacts his head of security, Earl Redburn.

Shelly informs Kevin that Max is heading to Washington, D.C. for a Senate hearing. Kevin learns that Max plans to bribe the senators and decides to replace the bribe money with insulting notes in Max's name. Max and Earl discover Kevin's presence in the apartment and a scuffle ensues. Kevin tries to steal the ring but ends up taking Max's wedding ring instead. Amber realizes the feud has gone too far and breaks up with Kevin, no longer caring about the ring.

Lutetia finds Amber wearing a stolen jacket at Jack's bar and confronts her. They realize they share a common situation and devise a plan. Gloria, concerned about Max, admits the gravity of the card she drew and quits as his associate. She provides Max's company records to Detective Tardio.

At the bankruptcy auction, Lutetia sends Max a masseuse as a distraction and steals the ring. The crooks, led by Kevin, steal as much as they can and escape, creating chaos with smoke bombs and a fake video message. Max confronts Kevin on a sinking boat, realizing the ring is a fake. They are discovered by Detective Tardio, and Kevin pretends to save Max. Kevin thanks Max, and Amber reveals herself as the masseuse who stole the ring. She advises Kevin to throw it away due to its bad luck. Kevin agrees, discards the ring, and reunites with Amber.

Pretending to be Max's lawyer, Kevin manipulates the Senate hearing in Max's favor, appearing victorious in the press conference. Kevin steals one of Max's watches as they part ways.

The 1960s was a golden age for Taiwanese films. Qi-sheng Liu (Shao-hua Long) tells his granddaughter Xiao-jie (Yi-jie Li) ”I was the most famous screenwriter at that time!” However, Xiao-jie does not believe that Taiwanese films used to be popular and doubts the story told by her grandfather. Xiao-jie's grandmother (Hai-rong Shen) has amnesia and confuses reality with dreams. She thought she was the wife of Bao-long Wan (Wang Po-Chieh), who was a Taiwanese film star at that time. Only when her grandfather tells Xiao-jie a love story that happened at that time does Xiao-jie finally understood that reason why her grandmother could not forget Bao-long Wan.<ref>[http://movie.douban.com/subject/11599155/ 阿嬤的夢中情人-豆瓣].</ref>

In 1969, the movie ''No.7 Spy (七號間諜; Qi Hao Jian Die)'' was released in Taiwan. Fans of Bao-long Wan lined up for the premiere hoping they could catch a glimpse of the famous star. The young Qi-sheng Liu (Blue Lan) was experiencing writer's block on his new screenplay and had just met a country girl Mei-yue Jiang (Amber An). By chance, Mei-yue came with the film crew and stood in as an extra on the set. Qi-sheng was attracted by her charm, but a movie star named Yue-feng Jin (Tien Hsin) wanted Qi-sheng for herself.<ref name=chr/>

After the success of ''No.7 Spy,'' the film company decided to produce a sequel. The relationship between Qi-sheng and Mei-yue was blossoming, but the director died suddenly when they started to produce the new film. The director of the film company asked Qi-sheng to take over this work and continue to produce the film. Unfortunately, a series of problems occurred ultimately leading to cancellation of the production. The plot terminates with the revealing of whether or not the dream lover of Xiao-jie's grandmother was her grandfather or the Taiwanese star Bao-long Wan.

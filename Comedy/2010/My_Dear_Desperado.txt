University graduate Han Se-jin (Jung Yu-mi) leaves her hometown, where her conservative father (Min Kyeong-jin) is the local stationmaster, for Seoul, where she has been offered a job in an IT company. Some time later, however, the company goes bankrupt and she's forced to move into a cheap basement flat while job-hunting. Her new neighbor is middle-aged Oh Dong-chul (Park Joong-hoon), a small-time gangster who works for boss Kim (Jeong Woo-hyeok) collecting loans. Se-jin is initially uncomfortable living next door to a gangster but later forms a wary friendship with him after he helps her out a couple of times. Depressed by her inability to get a job because of the economic recession, Se-jin ends up drinking with Dong-chul one evening and having a one-night stand with him. She later asks him to pose as her wealthy boyfriend on a trip home to visit her anxious father â€” though that doesn't quite go as planned, and Se-jin ends up staying on with her father. Meanwhile, Dong-chul, who has almost started a gang war back in Seoul by beating up some hapkido athletes in revenge, is told by boss Kim to formally apologize to the athletes' boss, former police detective Park (Jeong In-gi). Dong-cheol reluctantly agrees, but that same day Se-jin is due in Seoul for an important job interview.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=My Dear Desperado|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/my-dear-desperado|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Film Business Asia|date=20 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221123224/http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/my-dear-desperado|archivedate=21 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=My Dear Desperado|url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm10.html#desperado|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Koreanfilm.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mudge|first=James|title=My Dear Desperado (2010) Movie Review|url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/my-dear-desperado-2010-movie-review/|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Beyond Hollywood|date=17 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025130439/http://www.beyondhollywood.com/my-dear-desperado-2010-movie-review/|archive-date=25 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

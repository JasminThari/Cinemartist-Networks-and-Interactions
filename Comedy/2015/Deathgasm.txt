After experiencing the death of his father and the institutionalization of his mother, teenager Brodie is forced to live with his Uncle Albert in Greypoint. However, Brodie's love for metal music clashes with Uncle Albert's strict Christian beliefs. To make matters worse, he faces constant bullying at school, particularly from his cousin David. Brodie's only solace comes from his geeky friends Dion and Giles.

Everything changes when Brodie meets another metal enthusiast named Zakk, and the two form a band called Deathgasm. They are later joined by Dion and Giles, and together they embark on a musical journey. One day, Zakk convinces Brodie to explore an abandoned house in search of a legendary metal musician named Rikki Daggers. They stumble upon Daggers, who hands them a mysterious album before being killed by a man named Vadin.

It turns out that Vadin is a member of a cult seeking the Black Hymn, an ancient piece of sheet music capable of summoning demons. When Brodie discovers the Black Hymn hidden inside the album, Deathgasm decides to play it. The song causes strange occurrences, including Uncle Albert's terrifying reaction. Brodie realizes something is amiss and stops playing.

Meanwhile, Brodie's romantic life takes an unexpected turn when the beautiful Medina shows interest in him. They go on a date, but Brodie's shyness prevents him from making a move. However, tensions arise when Zakk intercepts a note from Medina to Brodie and lies about his disinterest in her, culminating in a kiss between Zakk and Medina.

As Brodie delves deeper into the Black Hymn's meaning, he discovers its connection to dark forces and the possession of the town's residents by Aeloth, a powerful demon. Seeking answers, Brodie and Zakk consult a fortune teller named Abigail, who reveals the demonic presence and the impending merging of Aeloth with the most evil human in town by 3 AM.

With the help of Dion, Giles, and Medina, Brodie and Zakk attempt to undo the summoning by playing the Black Hymn in reverse. Their journey leads them to face the cult members and their leader, Aeon, who is eventually killed by his acolyte Shanna. Despite setbacks, the group manages to acquire the sheet music and heads to Daggers' house to perform the song with his amplifiers.

However, the cult captures Deathgasm, and Shanna tears apart the sheets. Zakk, remorseful for his betrayal, saves his bandmates, and together they disrupt the cult's ritual. Brodie attempts to play the reversed Black Hymn, but the demons kill Dion and Giles, leaving him unable to finish in time. Aeloth possesses Shanna's body but is quickly dispatched by Zakk.

Realizing that completing the hymn is impossible, Brodie resorts to playing intense heavy metal music instead. This causes Aeloth to temporarily retreat from Zakk's body. Zakk urges Brodie to kill him to prevent Aeloth's resurrection, sacrificing himself to save his friends and the town.

Months later, Brodie and Medina are happily together, bonded by their love for death metal. Zakk's spirit returns through one of Brodie's records, and they engage in a conversation about the afterlife.

Five months after the events in ''Love in a Puff'', Jimmy and Cherie are currently living together. Jimmy is under much stress, working long hours. His previous boss, now working in Beijing, asks him to move there to work for him. Jimmy's commitment to his job and the decision to move to Beijing cause a rift in his relationship with Cherie. Eventually, they break up and he moves to Beijing.

On one of his business trips, he meets a flight attendant, You-you Shang, and they develop a romantic relationship.

Six months later, Cherie is also transferred to Beijing by her company. The two meet by chance but at this time, Cherie is also seeing a responsible and down-to-earth businessman, Sam. Jimmy and Cherie start to cheat behind Sam's and You-you's backs.  Initially, they both have a good time going on a few dates, but soon Cherie wants more than the status quo. She breaks it off with Jimmy a second time.  This time however, Jimmy decides to end his relationship with You-You and tries to win back Cherie, and in the end, succeeds.

A lonely chef with a speech impediment takes a job as a professional killer in order to raise the money he needs for an operation on his tongue. Known as "Killar" (Shin Ha-kyun), he and his partner "Ballet" (Kim Min-jun), make a rule to only kill rude and impolite people. After killing each one of his victims, "Killar" goes to the same bar where he meets "Her" (Yoon Ji-hye), a woman who becomes attracted to him. His life begins to unravel after he and "Ballet" kill the wrong person by mistake.

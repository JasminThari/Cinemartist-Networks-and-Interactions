Emily "Jacks" Jackson is an American transplant living in London and working as an intern at British ''Vogue''. She shares an apartment with her gay friend Peter Simon, a screenwriter. Afraid to be disappointed by a serious relationship, Jacks prefers to spend her free time with her friends and sleep with her ex-boyfriend, James, whom she does not love.

Peter, who has never been in a relationship, spends too much time in his dreams and as a result cannot fall in love with a real person. It gets more complicated with the entrance of Paolo, a photography assistant for one of the photographers at Vogue.  As the film develops, they come to realize their mistakes and eventually reach their happy endings.

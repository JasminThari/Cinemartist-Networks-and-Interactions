At a secluded luxury hotel in Sardinia owned by Graziella, beautiful Italian wife of the still handsome Popeye who now likes to be known as Robert, the other characters from the first two films, now in their 50s, start arriving. Robert is distracted by pursuing an affair with a girl who works in the kitchens and insists he leave his wife. Bernard and Nathalie, who own a chain of opticians' shops, have a son who arrives to announce his civil union with an older man. J-C is a bald hairdresser in the US, living with Gigi who has acquired enormous silicon breasts requiring an F cup bra. Jérôme, struck off for malpractice and divorced, is reduced to giving driving lessons. Christiane, scarred for life by an operation Jérôme botched, has with Miguel joined a weird Indian sect and seeks revenge.

Gigi, flirtatious as ever, has a resumed fling with Jérôme. Nathalie, to punish Bernard for reacting so hostilely to his son's homosexuality, claims she conceived him with another man in the alpine cabin where they all spent a night 27 years ago. Graziella, fed up with the bickering and bed-hopping of her husband's embarrassing French friends, throws the lot out to spend the night with their luggage on the beach. Then she learns from the last character Gilbert, a sacked ex-employee, about Robert's infidelity and throws him out too. In the morning the group are joined by a boatload of illegal immigrants from North Africa, with whom they are bundled into vans by the police and taken to an internment camp.

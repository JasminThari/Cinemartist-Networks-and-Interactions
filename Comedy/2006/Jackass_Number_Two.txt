The film opens by introducing the primary cast members while bulls aggressively chase them in a suburban neighborhood, wreaking havoc in the process.

The most notable stunts include: Johnny Knoxville riding a big red rocket which gets launched into the air; Bam Margera being trapped and stuck in a trailer with a cobra; Dave England riding a giant firehose that launches him into a patch of mud; Ryan Dunn being launched into a garage door while riding a shopping cart; Chris Pontius' penis dressed as a mouse while a snake attempts to bite it; Wee Man getting zapped by an electric stool upon believing that cards are being thrown at him; Steve-O getting his cheek pierced by a fish hook and getting thrown into the shark-infested Gulf of Mexico; Preston Lacy disguising himself as Bam's father Phil, in order to spoon with Bam's mother April in bed; and Ehren McGhehey attempting a loop while riding a pocketbike.

The final stunt is a prank orchestrated by the entire cast and crew on Ehren McGhehey, in which Ehren dresses up as a terrorist along with cinematographer Dimitry Elyashkevich, and the pair take a taxi to the airport, convincing the taxi driver that they are going to blow up a plane. In reality, the driver is swapped with director/actor Jay Chandrasekhar, who becomes violent with Ehren when he attempts to initiate the prank. The taxi then pulls into a vacant lot, where a panicked Ehren is forced into the trunk and Jay drives around the lot in circles. When the car comes to a stop, Ehren is relieved to discover that it is a prank and that he was never in serious danger. However, it is also revealed to Ehren that the beard that was put on him as part of the bit was made up of pubic hair by a majority of the cast and crew, one of whom actually happened to have crabs, after which Ehren gets angry and dry heaves.

The movie concludes with Johnny Knoxville putting his hand in a bear trap, before transitioning into a performance by the main cast in a Busby Berkeley-style movie musical production number set to the ''La Cage aux Folles'' song "The Best of Times", where the guys sing and dance while performing more stunts. After a wrecking ball hits Knoxville, Rip Taylor appears to end the movie much like in the predecessor.

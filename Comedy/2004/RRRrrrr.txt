35,000 years ago, in the Stone Age, two neighbouring tribes lived in peace. The Tribe of Clean Hair was peaceful, due to its possession of the shampoo formula. The Tribe of Dirty Hair is at odds with the Tribe of Clean Hair due to this, and their leader wished for access to the formula of shampoo..

The leader of the Dirty Hair tribe decides to send a spy to steal the recipe. But a far more serious event would upset the life of Clean Hair tribe; for the first time in the history of humanity, a murder had been committed.

The tribes begin the first criminal investigation in human history.

Zoe Adler (Robin Tunney), is a shy, eccentric and misunderstood computer animator who lives and works in San Francisco, has a love for 1970s and 80s pop music and is infatuated with co-worker Andrew (Jason Priestley).  While heading home after a few drinks one night, she is forced into her car by a stalker who steers her into a police officer, knocking him off his bicycle and killing him.

When Zoe is put under house arrest with a story no one believes and an electronic bracelet that keeps her homebound with an ever-increasing list of mandatory and repetitive tasks she must complete or risk going to jail, she must find a way to clear her name.  With the help of Daly (Tim Blake Nelson), an officer responsible for checking her bracelet every week who falls for her, a downstairs neighbor, and neighborhood kids, Zoe finds her stalker and tries to clear her name.

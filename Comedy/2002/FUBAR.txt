''FUBAR'' is the story of two lifelong friends, Terry Cahill (Dave Lawrence) and Dean Murdoch (Paul Spence), who have grown up together: shotgunning their first beers, forming their first garage band, and growing the great Canadian mullet known as "Hockey Hair". The lives of these Alberta everymen are brought to the big screen by documentarian Farrel Mitchner (Gordon Skilling), a young director who decides to take a look at Terry and Dean through a lens, exploring the depths of their friendship, the fragility of life, growing up gracefully, and the art and science of drinking beer "like a man".

Their lives are complicated by a snubbing by their "party leader" Troy, better known as Tron (Andrew Sparacino).  When Farrel discovers that Dean is hiding a serious case of testicular cancer, the wheels are set in motion for Dean to seek treatment from Dr. S.C. Lim (Dr. S.C. Lim).  With Dean's last weekend before surgery approaching, Terry decides to take Dean, Farrel and the film crew camping.  Things take an unexpected turn by the third day, and Terry and Dean must cope with further tragedy.<ref>Slone, M. & Michael Ladano: Story Synopsis (first paragraph) written by Mark Slone.

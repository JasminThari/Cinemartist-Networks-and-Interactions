Jung-woo is a na√Øve music director of film and commercials, and works part-time at a music institute run by his friend. Until one day, his friend flees from his debts and workload, leaving Jung-woo to face the angry creditors, one of whom takes Jung-woo's precious guitar. While having a drink with director Kim, one of the creditors, Jung-woo meets Soo-kyung, whose sister is involved in the director's project. Soo-kyung is a promising creative director at an advertising agency, and Jung-woo's brief encounter with her leaves a good impression on him. When Jung-woo takes a job working on commercial music to buy back his guitar, the two run into each other. As they begin to spend time together at work and after-hours drinks, the more Jung-woo and Soo-kyung learn about each other. Aside from feeling attraction towards each other, they realize that they have several things in common, like coming from an atypical family and dreams of going on a winery tour. However, their relationship is put to the test when Jung-woo doesn't show up on the day of Soo-kyung's presentation because he was caught in heavy traffic. Soo-kyung misunderstands, calling him irresponsible, and the two break up. But not long after, they get a chance to work together on a project in Santa Barbara, California, which happens to be the location of their dream winery tour.

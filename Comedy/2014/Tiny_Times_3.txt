Gu Li heads to Rome to attend a fashion show. At the insistence of Gong Ming, Lin Xiao follows suit, along with Nan Xiang and Tang Wan Ru. A mad chase thus follows, with the girls touring Rome and meeting all sorts of adventures along the way.

When in Rome, Gu Li runs into her cousin Neil, an Ivy League law student. Suddenly, Lin Xiao receives a call from China, informing her that her cancer-stricken boyfriend, Zhou Chong Guang has died. She flies home for the funeral of her lover, where she sees a Chong Guang lookalike named Lu Shao appearing on the cover of M.E. magazine. This puzzles Lin Xiao who ponders about his true identity.

At the same time, Gu Li's half-brother Gu Zhun appears, claiming to own 20% of the shares of their father's company. As the company has been forcefully acquired by Gu Yuan's mother and Gong Ming, the siblings work together to take back their inheritance.

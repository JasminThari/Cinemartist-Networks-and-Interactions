Hannah, a former reality star, and Brooklyn, a social media influencer, are a pair of best friends and wannabe celebrities who have recently moved out to Hollywood.

When they ultimately find him unappealing, they decide to spend a debauchery-filled night out in the city that will test the limits of their friendship.

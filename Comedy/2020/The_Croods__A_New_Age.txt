The Croods, including Guy and their pets, Chunky and Douglas, are still on a quest to find a suitable place to settle while battling dangerous creatures. Grug, the family patriarch, is increasingly concerned about the budding romance between Guy and his daughter, Eep, fearing they might leave the rest of the family behind.

Their journey takes an unexpected turn when Grug discovers a massive wall and leads the family to a paradise-like land on the other side. However, they are soon captured by the land's owners, Phil and Hope Betterman, who were friends with Guy's parents and are now technologically advanced, well-mannered, and somewhat condescending toward the Croods. Phil and Hope hope to persuade Guy to stay with them, believing he would be better off, and devise a plan to get him to leave the Croods.

Grug's time with the Betterman family becomes uncomfortable as he is manipulated by Phil, who believes that Guy should stay with them in exchange for Eep staying with her family. Hope also tries to manipulate Ugga, Grug's wife, but fails, leading to Grug and Ugga's decision to leave. Eep discovers that Phil and Hope's daughter, Dawn, has never left the inside of the wall. Feeling isolated, Eep persuades Dawn to escape with her for a joyride using Chunky, but their adventure goes awry. Upon their return, Guy scolds Eep for her recklessness, leading to a falling out between them. During dinner, tensions escalate, and Grug accidentally reveals the plan hatched with Phil.

Fed up with the Betterman's condescension and their differences, the Croods decide to leave, while Guy opts to stay behind. However, their departure is soon disrupted by an attack from Punch Monkeys who hold a grudge against the Croods for consuming the bananas that Phil had been providing as a daily offering. The Punch Monkeys capture Grug, Phil, and Guy and take them to their home. As the remaining Croods and Bettermans leave to rescue their loved ones, they find themselves marooned in a frozen wasteland, where they encounter Wolf-Spiders. During their time together, Hope finally comes to terms with her prejudice against the Croods and accepts them as equals. They decide to name themselves "The Thunder Sisters." They eventually locate the men and save them.

Grug, Guy, and Phil discover the reason behind the Punch Monkeys' aggression: Phil's irrigation project deprived them of their water supply, and they need the bananas as an offering to the Spiny Mandrilla, a gigantic primate-like monster, to maintain peace. The Punch Monkeys prepare to sacrifice Grug, Phil, and Guy to the Spiny Mandrilla. Guy and Eep reconcile and use a giant skull-chandelier to defeat the Spiny Mandrilla. The creature plummets to its death, and the two families manage to escape the danger.

With their differences resolved, the Bettermans invited the Croods to live as neighbors on their land. Guy and Eep choose to share one of the Bettermans' bedrooms, and the Punch Monkeys become their next-door neighbors.

As a favor to a friend, Sam reluctantly begins a road trip to his hometown with his high school bully Harry. During the trip Harry casually reveals himself to be pansexual, shocking Sam that they share a connection. However, upon arrival Harry ditches Sam to make up with his ex-girlfriend.

A year later, Sam runs into Harry during a party, and he insults Harry by calling him a slut, despite his best friend Stasia pushing them together. Six months later, Sam is brought by his new boyfriend Paul to a bar trivia where he stumbles upon Harry and his roommate, Zach. Sam chooses Harry's answer to a trivia question over Paul's, causing Paul to leave and break up with him.

Over the next few months, Sam and Harry grow closer as friends. During the Chicago Pride celebration at a bar, Harry asks Sam whether the latter will consider dating him. Sam reiterates his stance against dating friends, and thereafter stumbles upon Harry making out with Stasia, the two of which then become a couple. At a brunch three months later, a drunk Sam insults Stasia and Harry by predicting their relationship won't last, after which he loses contact with both.

With encouragement from his roommate Casey, Sam begins finding dates using apps, which does not go well. A year later, Stasia reconnects with Sam and asks him to be the man of honor in her wedding to Zach, revealing that she broke up with Harry sometime ago. At the wedding, Sam finally makes up with Harry after the latter confesses his love, and they spend the night together. In the morning after, Harry reveals he is moving away in a week, causing Sam to storm out due to feelings of mistrust and betrayal.

With Sam again ignoring him, Harry accidentally sees on TV that Sam is working at a political rally. Determined to face him, Harry sneaks into the rally. Onstage, he apologizes to Sam and states that nothing is more important than staying together with him. A few years later, Sam and Harry are married and raising a child together.

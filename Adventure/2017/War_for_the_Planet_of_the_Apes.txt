An Alpha-Omega platoon assaults an ape outpost which the apes repelled with only a handful of survivors and Red from the platoon. Caesar orders the apes to release the survivors to show a desire for peace, but Red escapes from Winter. Caesar's eldest son, Blue Eyes, and friend Rocket return to the ape colony after discovering an oasis, a safer home for the colony. The colonel leads a team to infiltrate the apes' home and kills Caesar's wife and Blue Eyes, mistaking the latter for Caesar.

Rocket, Maurice, and Luca accompany Caesar to serve as a decoy while the tribe journeys to the oasis. Caesar kills a paramilitary soldier in self-defense and finds the man's mute daughter whom Maurice befriends, giving her a rag doll. Caesar's party finds Winter and confronts him about the Colonel's location. He reveals that the Colonel is heading north to meet up with more soldiers before Caesar inadvertently kills him when they are about to be discovered. Along the way, Caesar's party discovers other soldiers executed and left for dead. One of the survivors who has been shot reveals that he is mute like the girl.

Caesar's group chases someone who has stolen one of their horses and is surprised to see that he is another intelligent ape, named Bad Ape. Bad Ape informs them that the militia is at a former quarantine facility with an arsenal in the mountains. Luca is killed by a patrol and Caesar is captured when they try to get close, discovering his tribe is also captured and forced to build a wall.

Caesar confronts the Colonel and deduces that the militia is barricading the facility to fend off other military forces who are coming for them. The Colonel reveals that the Simian Flu has mutated and the infected humans have become mute and devolve into primitive animals. He ordered his soldiers to kill any carriers before they could infect other people which led to disagreements with other soldiers who were still searching for a cure. Caesar is tortured and kept starving to force the tribe to work. The mute girl, named Nova by Maurice, sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her doll. Rocket allows himself to be captured to prevent Nova from being seen so he and Caesar can formulate a plan to escape. The Colonel later confiscates the doll.

Caesar and Rocket free the apes via an underground tunnel leading out of the facility. The facility comes under attack by the military and Caesar sneaks into the Colonel's quarters and is about to shoot him but realizes the Colonel has become mute after handling the doll. The Colonel begs Caesar to shoot him, but he refuses, so the Colonel commits suicide.

The escaping apes are caught in the crossfire. Caesar attempts to blow up a fuel tank to take out the militia from behind with grenades but is shot by Preacher, one of the soldiers he set free. Red has a change of heart and kills Preacher but is immediately killed by another soldier. Caesar blows the tank, triggering an avalanche that kills the militia and the military while the apes and Nova survive by climbing nearby trees.

The apes and Nova reach the oasis. As Maurice and Caesar watch Nova and Caesar's son in their new home, Maurice discovers Caesar's wound. He promises Caesar that his son will know who Caesar is and what he did for the apes before Caesar passes away.

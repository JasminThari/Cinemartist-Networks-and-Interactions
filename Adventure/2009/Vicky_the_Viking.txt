Vicky (Jonas Hämmerle) is the son of Halvar (Waldemar Kobus), chief of the Viking village of Flake. Halvar is a strong and big warrior who measures the strength of people through muscles. Vicky, on the other hand, is a small but very smart boy who always has to prove his father that the ingenuity of a man can meet muscles.

One day the village of Flake falls under attack, and all the children – including Vicky's girlfriend Ylvi (Mercedes Jadea Diaz) – are kidnapped except for Vicky himself, so Vicky, his father Halvar and the other Vikings of the village decide to go out and try to rescue them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wickie.film.de/ |title=KonsoleH :: Login |access-date=2013-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122202213/http://www.wickie.film.de/ |archive-date=2013-11-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The kidnappers turn out to be Sven the Terrible and his band of Viking pirates, who are hunting for a legendary treasure, and in order to gain it, they need the assistance of a child who has never spoken a lie in his or her life. Whilst in pursuit, the Flake Vikings pick up a young Chinese girl and an obnoxious bard (Michael Herbig) for company, and together they succeed in rescuing the children, outsmarting Sven and escaping back to Flake with the treasure (though it is not as bountiful as they might have imagined).

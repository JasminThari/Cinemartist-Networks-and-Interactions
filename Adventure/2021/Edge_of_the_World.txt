The film is based on the true story of the Rajah of Sarawak, James Brooke, who has been suggested as one of the inspirations for the Rudyard Kipling story ''The Man Who Would Be King'', and Joseph Conrad's novel ''Lord Jim''. Brooke was a former soldier in the Bengal Army who sailed to Borneo which was still under the control of  Bruneian Sultanate in 1839, where he helped the Sultan of Brunei's governor (Pengiran Indera Mahkota, title for the governor) put down a local rebellion and took over as governor of what became the Raj of Sarawak as his own private kingdom. He was knighted by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom prior to being appointed Governor of the new Crown Colony of Labuan. Brooke's dynasty lasted three generations and spanned a century.<ref>{{Cite web|title=StackPath|url=https://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2021/03/25/historical-epic-edge-of-the-world-gets-a-trailer-hits-digital-and-dvd-in-june/|access-date=2021-03-28|website=www.thehollywoodnews.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=S|first1=Ian|last2=well|date=2021-03-15|title=First trailer for Lord of the Rings and Vikings stars' new movie Edge of the World|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/trailers/a35837726/edge-of-the-world-trailer-dominic-monaghan/|access-date=2021-03-28|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB}}</ref>

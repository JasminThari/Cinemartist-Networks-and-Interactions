{{More plot|date=April 2021}}In Pre-England Britain, before the birth of King Arthur, Merlin (Simon Lloyd Roberts) serves under King Vortigern (Hefin Wyn).

Soon after Vortigern's coronation, fire-breathing dragons land in Britain, setting fire to buildings and eating its inhabitants. The dragons threaten the existence of Britain, and Vortigern instructs Merlin to lead an army against the dragons, ordering his best generals, Hengist (Iago McGuire) and Uther (Dylan Jones) to aid Merlin.

Merlin plots to defeat the dragons and defeats them using magic/knowledge.

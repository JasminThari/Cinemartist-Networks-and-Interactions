Ben "Finn" Finnegan is a treasure hunter searching for the sunken Spanish galleon, the ''Aurelia'', that was lost at sea with the 1715 Treasure Fleet, known as the Queen's Dowry. He finds a fragment of dishware produced as part of the treasure. Finn appeals to his creditor Bigg Bunny for help finding the Queen's Dowry, but Bigg wants the treasure for himself and takes the fragment. 

Finn's ex-wife Tess is working as a steward on a yacht owned by multi-millionaire Nigel Honeycutt. Finn dramatically saves a flyaway hat belonging to Nigel's daughter Gemma. Finn is taken aboard the yacht and reunites with Tess. They tell Nigel and Gemma about the fabled Queen's Dowry, and persuade them to fund the search. Tess and Finn find and follow clues to an ancient church and discover a diary describing the treasure's location. They celebrate by having passionate sex. Unfortunately, Bigg has been following them; he takes Tess hostage and forces her find the treasure in a blowhole. 

Finn enlists his former mentor Moe Fitch to help. They rescue Tess but Bigg kidnaps her again onto his plane. Gemma gets Finn to the plane on her jet ski, and he leaps onto the plane's pontoon as it takes flight. As Bigg attempts to shoot Finn, Tess kicks Bigg out of the plane to his death. In the end, the treasure is displayed in Moe's museum, now renamed the Fitch-Finnegan Maritime Museum. Tess and Finn are back together, and she is shown to be pregnant.

The film takes place in a fictional central African country (called Daresalam, "the Land of Peace" in Arabic) amidst a civil war. It features as main characters two young friends, Koni (Haikal Zakaria) and Djimi (Abdoulaye Ahmat), whose peaceful existence is interrupted when the central government irrupts in their village harassing them and browbeating the villagers into paying new taxes to help fight the civil war.

A heated discussion ensues, which degenerates, causing the death of a government official,  which causes in retaliation the burning of the village and the massacre of its inhabitants. Koni and Djimi now pass with others to the rebellion, but the rebels eventually split, with Djimi remaining with the hardliners and Koni going instead with a faction that supports compromise with the government, thus estranging the two friends. Koni will later be executed in a coup, while Djimi will leave the rebels and return to his home village with a war widow and a sewing machine left to him by a fallen combatant,  with which he can attempt to start a new life for himself and his family.<ref>[http://www.newsreel.org/nav/title.asp?tc=CN0124 Daresalam]</ref>

Director Issa Coelo, in speaking of his film, explains he wanted to expose the vicious circle that originates when a despotic government causes the outbreak of a civil war, which ends to feed itself endlessly, as each power maintains itself through despotism, thus generating its own armed opposition. In Coelo's words, "war becomes the only economy of the country. Violence, the only way of speech and communication possible. ... With in mind the myth of Cain and Abel, ''Daresalam'' narrates how this war machine finishes to pit one against the other two friends, at the beginning moved by the same ideals. This story is meant to be a speech against war and for humanity's survival."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/actions-france_830/cinema_886/cooperation-cinematographique_5371/aides-production_5622/films-aides_5623/films-aides-par-fonds-sud_5624/tchad_7808/daresalam_7836/fiche-film_18526.html |title=Daresalam - Fiche film -Ministère des Affaires étrangères |access-date=2007-10-15 |archive-date=2011-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524050504/http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/actions-france_830/cinema_886/cooperation-cinematographique_5371/aides-production_5622/films-aides_5623/films-aides-par-fonds-sud_5624/tchad_7808/daresalam_7836/fiche-film_18526.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

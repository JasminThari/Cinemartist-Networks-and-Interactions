{{More plot|date=September 2015}}
A meteorite splits and one piece lands on a car in the small town of Lennox; the other piece in the mountains outside town. The town begins to progressively flash freeze, and the effect spreads outward at an alarming rate. Charlie Ratchet, a local father, teams up with Alex Novak, a graduate student who wants to study the meteorite. Together they set out to counter the effects of the freezing meteorite on their town before everything, and every one, ends up frozen. Meanwhile, Tim Ratchet, Charlie's son, goes out into the storm to find and rescue Marley Crooge, and the two fight to survive the cold to make it back to safety.

The film centers on a young family that moves to a new apartment in the outskirts of the big city. The nanny they hired to look after their newborn daughter quickly becomes trustworthy. However, the eldest boy, Egor, notices the frightening behavior of the woman, but his parents do not believe him. The surveillance cameras installed by his father for reassurance only confirm that everything is in order. 

One day, Egor returns home and does not find any traces of either the nanny or his little sister. His parents seem to be in a strange trance and do not even remember that they have ever had a daughter. Then Egor together with his friends arranges a search, during which they find out that the disappeared nanny is actually an ancient Slavic demonic witch known as Baba Yaga.

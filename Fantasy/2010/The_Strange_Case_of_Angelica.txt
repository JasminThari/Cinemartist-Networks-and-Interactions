In Portugal, in the years 2000, Isaac, a young Sefardic photographer rents an apartment in a modest pension of Senhora Justina, in Peso da Régua. On a rainy night, he is suddenly woken up to help a wealthy family in an extraordinary task: to take the last portrait of their daughter, Angélica, a young woman who has died soon after her own wedding. Upon his arrival to Quinta das Portas, Isaac encounters a family in mourning for the young woman. In one of the chambers, the photographer discovers Angélica and is dazzled by her beauty. In the moment when the view through the lens becomes focused, Angélica seems bringing back to life specially for him. For a few seconds, she gives a wink and smiles.

The next day, the photographer returns to the activity that brought him to the Douro region and goes out to document the old methods of working in the vineyards, with special attention to the so-called "earth diggers". But Isaac cannot forget the image of Angelica and feels magically haunted by the young woman. He lives in pursuit of the enchanting power of the successive apparitions of Angélica's ghost, which leave him deeply in love. Gradually, the photographer becomes exhausted and more and more distances himself from the environment that surrounds him and from life and social routine, until he ends up succumbing without apparent explanation.
